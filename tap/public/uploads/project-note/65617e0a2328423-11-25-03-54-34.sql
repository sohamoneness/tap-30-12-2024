Also, they want you to know something is wrong. And yet their words convey the opposite of the truth.</p><p>Humans have evolved to take in everything from body language and facial expressions to voice tones to help them understand others.&nbsp;</p><p>As a writer, it’s your job to put your clients in the best light possible in front of their target audience. In the absence of body language, facial expressions, and voice tones, your tone of voice through words alone must do the job of all these aspects.</p><p>Does that sound daunting?</p><p>Don’t worry. We’ll show you how to find the perfect brand tone with tone of voice examples, for every client you write for.</p><p></p><p>You\'ll learn how to find a brand\'s personality by focusing on brand values and brand persona. Clients/customers expect brands to have a consistent tone, and you will be at the forefront of providing this - read on.</p><h2>Tone of voice definition</h2><p>It\'s essentially about how your brand speaks to the audience and what they see and hear. Tone means how you communicate rather than what you communicate.</p><p></p><h2>Why do your clients need to get their brand voice right?</h2><p>The perfect brand tone and brand voice creates an emotional connection with potential clients/customers. It makes people feel their core values are the same as the brand\'s core values.</p><p>It inspires potential customers/clients to make positive actions, whether that\'s buying a product/service, signing a contract, donating money/time, etc.</p><p>Remember, <em>everything</em> you write for a client has a commercial aspect to it.&nbsp;</p><p>You may not be writing ‘hard’ sales copy, such as sales letters, landing pages, etc. Perhaps you’re tasked with ‘soft’ content strategy, such as blog posts, social media posts, or relationship-building emails.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all content is still geared towards profits. And that’s why getting the right brand tone and brand voice is so crucial.</p><p>Many amateur writers believe that they just need a wider vocabulary or the latest copywriting ‘hack’ to become great writers.</p><p>Instead, pro writers have a knack for hitting just the right tone of voice with a target market to inspire them to take action.</p><p>Think about it. If you were a business owner paying someone to write content for you, who would you choose? The writer with a vast vocabulary and clever turns of phrases? Or the writer who hits the right tone of voice to trigger emotional responses in your potential customers/clients so they buy, sign up, etc.?</p><h2>How do I find the perfect brand tone for a client?</h2><p>If your client has worked extensively with freelancers and/or in-house writers, they’re likely to have brand voice guidelines or style guides.</p><p>This certainly makes your job easier. The assumption is that your client has done their due diligence, knows their customers/clients inside out, and they know what tone of voice works.&nbsp;</p><p>However, you may have a client who hasn’t done any in-depth research on the correct tone of voice. Worse still, you may have a client who is making huge assumptions about their customers/clients that are wrong.</p><p>Whether you like it or not, this will impact how well your content performs. You could write the best content in the world, but if the tone of voice is off, it will fall flat as it won’t resonate with the audience.</p><p>Ask the following questions to your new client to build a style guide:</p><ol><li><p>What business challenges do you currently have?</p></li></ol><p>This question helps you understand if the current brand tone of voice is correct or not.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if your client says they need more leads but have a high conversion rate, you know the issue is with reach and not tone. When people discover their products/services, they’re ‘sold.’ They resonate with the message and take positive action.</p><p>However, if your client says they need more leads but have a low conversion rate, it means something is off. They don’t need more leads. They need to convert more of their existing leads. One reason could be an issue with the brand tone of voice with the existing content.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Which businesses do you consider your competitors?</p></li></ol><p>This question allows you to see what others are doing and the tone of voice they are using that could be working for them.</p><p>Direct competitors are businesses that have the same target audience as your client. If you discover that a competitor has a lion’s share of the market, it’s common sense to analyze the tone of voice their content is taking. Success leaves clues!</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p>If your target audience was one person, who are they? Describe them to me.</p></li></ol><p>This is a clever way to get your client to focus.</p><p>If you asked, “Who is your target audience,” you may get generic answers, such as middle managers, which is too broad.&nbsp;</p><p>By asking your client to distill their audience down to one person, you will get specifics, such as age, gender, likes/dislikes, etc. The best writers will drill down much further, such as what publications/websites they read, what they do in their spare time, etc., to refine the tone of voice they should use when writing.</p><p>Think of how easy it is to write an email to your best friend. You know their personality, their likes and dislikes, and you know what offends them and what doesn’t. If you’re able to get to this level, that’s when your writing will resonate deeply.</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p>What do you want your potential customers/clients to do?</p></li></ol><p>Remember, even ‘soft’ content that is not directly selling something still has a commercial aspect to it. No business is willing to spend money with zero return on investment.</p><p>You need to find out what your client wants their audience to do overall (very likely to be a monetary transaction) and also the smaller action steps for different content pieces. E.g., signing up to get a free sample/report, upgrading product after initial purchase, etc.</p><h2>What are the main brand voice tones for businesses?</h2><p>There are numerous words to describe tone. For example, passionate, dry, bold, down-to-earth, informative, etc.</p><p>But ultimately, all business content falls into five tone of voice types:</p><ol><li><p>Energetic</p></li><li><p>Dependable</p></li><li><p>Elegant/Expensive</p></li><li><p>Irreverent</p></li><li><p>Innovative</p></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Understanding which of the five your client’s audience falls into will make or break your content.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Let’s look at some examples using the five tone of voice types.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem; font-weight: bold;\">Energetic</span><br></p><p>This is a good tone of voice to hit if your client’s ideal customers/clients are in the youth market (e.g. teen clothes, ‘young’ social media networks and apps, etc.)&nbsp;</p><p>It also works well in markets designed to utilize energy, such as gyms, sports clothing, exercise programs, etc.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.3125rem; font-weight: bold;\">How to hit an energetic brand tone</span><br></p><p>An energetic style guide uses lots of bullet-pointed or numbered lists. Don’t use long sentences with a ton of conjunctions.</p><p></p><p>Fragmented sentence structure with a motivating tone works well.</p><p>Also, use short words for a brand voice that packs a punch.</p><p>Here’s a great energetic tone of voice example:</p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout\"><u>https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout</u></a><u>. </u>Can you see how the brand\'s voice has a \'go-getter\' personality with a motivating tone throughout?</p><h3>Dependable</h3><p>This is the perfect tone of voice when your client’s products/services are something that their clients/customers rely on.</p><p></p><p>The product or service may not be the most exciting, but people value these products or services for their dependability over excitement.</p><p>Great examples are insurance companies, payment/merchant service providers, hosting companies, etc.</p><p>This doesn’t mean your words can’t inject a little energy or humor. But keep in mind that the audience is ultimately looking for safety. &nbsp;Use a more formal tone of voice.</p><h4>How to hit a dependable brand tone</h4><p>A dependable style guide uses words that are wholesome and feel comfortable and warm.&nbsp;At the same time, you want a slightly authoritative tone of voice.</p><p>More so than any other tone type, avoid using any words that can offend, such as curse words. This will likely go against brand values. This is not the audience to be ‘edgy’ with. Avoid using slang or colloquialisms for the same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a good dependable tone of voice example:</p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/\"><u>https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/</u></a>. Check out the respectful tone and writing style throughout.</p><h3>Elegant/Expensive</h3><p>This is the must-use tone of voice for high-end items, boutiques, or any product or service that’s targeted at the affluent. It’s also an ideal tone of voice for salons, spas, and resorts.</p><h4>How to hit an elegant and expensive brand tone</h4><p>An elegant and expensive style guide uses a longer sentence structure that flows well with conjunctions.</p><p></p><p>Use adjectives to create a world inside the reader’s mind so they can imagine the pleasure. Keep content about the functional aspect of a product or service to a minimum.</p><p>Avoid using action-oriented words and short, punchy sentences. Nothing in your content should convey that there is a rush.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at this example of an elegant/expensive brand tone of voice:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.joali.com/\"><u>https://www.joali.com/</u></a>&nbsp;to see the brand\'s tone and brand personality that oozes luxury and elegance.</p><h3>Irreverent</h3><p>This is a humorous tone of voice for businesses and brands who want to be seen as ‘out of the box’ thinkers.</p><p>Therefore, it lends itself to apps and games targeted at the youth (especially males) as well as street brands.</p><p>However, irreverent, offbeat humor can be used for all kinds of products and services - it’s all about knowing your audience.</p><h4>How to hit an irreverent brand tone</h4><p>According to Merriam-Webster, irreverent means “lacking proper respect or seriousness.”</p><p>However, you need to understand the audience to know what they like to disrespect - it’s not a case of just disrespecting anything and everything! Therefore, hitting the right irreverent tone of voice is a bit harder than other tones.</p><p>Your client needs to give you lots of tone of voice guidelines regarding their perfect customers/clients. so you can assess personality traits, word choice, and communication style.</p><p>Here’s one of the best irreverent tone of voice examples for a … wait for it… life insurance company called Dead Happy!</p><p>Check out the unique tone of the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://deadhappy.com/\"><u>https://deadhappy.com/</u></a>. We\'re sure you\'ll agree. It\'s a very unique brand voice with a clear tone and very distinct personality.</p><p>As you can see with this example, this flies against the earlier advice that insurance companies should go for a more dependable tone.</p><p>However, the reason why this content works so well is that the business knows its audience (young, upwardly mobile, and savvy, who love dark humor). They are able to show off the brand\'s personality with offbeat humor.</p><h3>Innovative</h3><p>It will come as no surprise that this tone of voice is perfect for software companies, app firms, and any product/service which is cutting edge.&nbsp;</p><p>If your client can succinctly tell you that “no one is doing exactly what we’re doing” when you ask about their competitors, you know you have an innovative brand.</p><p>That doesn’t mean they don’t have competitors at all. But they will have major differentiation points.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to hit an innovative brand tone</h4><p>Innovative people tend to use fewer words. So keep your content succinct.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, don’t be overly formal. Think of how we became accustomed to seeing Steve Jobs in jeans. Innovative brands prefer conversational language with an informative tone.</p><p>However, don’t go overboard and start using colloquial language that starts hitting an irreverent tone. Word choice is important.</p><p>Finally, testimonials that ‘prove’ how great a product/service is will work better than marketing messages. That’s true for all brands, but more so for innovative brands.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a good innovative tone of voice example:&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Check out the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://streamyard.com/￼\">https://streamyard.com/</a> where you can see the innovative brand personality and tone of voice, together with a powerful testimonial.</p><h2>Getting the brand\'s tone equals a highly effective (and highly paid) writer</h2><p>Robert Cialdini introduced six persuasion principles in his international bestseller, the Psychology of Persuasion (a must-read for new and experienced writers).</p><p>One of these principles is likability. The first step when we start any relationship, commercial or otherwise, is liking that person, business, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>The right tone of voice in your content creates likability immediately, which is the first step to the audience engaging with a business or brand. So you must take time to find the correct brand tone of voice for each client.&nbsp;</p><p>The more you hit the correct, consistent brand tone of voice, the more effective your content becomes. The more successes you have, the more you get paid!</p><p><br><br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>', 'Humans have evolved to take in everything from body language and facial expressions to voice tones to help them understand others.', 'Ultimate Guide to Tone of Voice Examples (with templates)', NULL, 0, 0.00, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, '2023-01-30 19:09:45', '2023-01-30 08:14:39', '2023-01-05 03:53:16', '2023-01-30 08:14:39'),

Also, they want you to know something is wrong. And yet their words convey the opposite of the truth.</p><p>Humans have evolved to take in everything from body language and facial expressions to voice tones to help them understand others.&nbsp;</p><p>As a writer, it’s your job to put your clients in the best light possible in front of their target audience. In the absence of body language, facial expressions, and voice tones, your tone of voice through words alone must do the job of all these aspects.</p><p>Does that sound daunting?</p><p>Don’t worry. We’ll show you how to find the perfect brand tone with tone of voice examples, for every client you write for.</p><p></p><p>You\'ll learn how to find a brand\'s personality by focusing on brand values and brand persona. Clients/customers expect brands to have a consistent tone, and you will be at the forefront of providing this - read on.</p><h2>Tone of voice definition</h2><p>It\'s essentially about how your brand speaks to the audience and what they see and hear. Tone means how you communicate rather than what you communicate.</p><p></p><h2>Why do your clients need to get their brand voice right?</h2><p>The perfect brand tone and brand voice creates an emotional connection with potential clients/customers. It makes people feel their core values are the same as the brand\'s core values.</p><p>It inspires potential customers/clients to make positive actions, whether that\'s buying a product/service, signing a contract, donating money/time, etc.</p><p>Remember, <em>everything</em> you write for a client has a commercial aspect to it.&nbsp;</p><p>You may not be writing ‘hard’ sales copy, such as sales letters, landing pages, etc. Perhaps you’re tasked with ‘soft’ content strategy, such as blog posts, social media posts, or relationship-building emails.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all content is still geared towards profits. And that’s why getting the right brand tone and brand voice is so crucial.</p><p>Many amateur writers believe that they just need a wider vocabulary or the latest copywriting ‘hack’ to become great writers.</p><p>Instead, pro writers have a knack for hitting just the right tone of voice with a target market to inspire them to take action.</p><p>Think about it. If you were a business owner paying someone to write content for you, who would you choose? The writer with a vast vocabulary and clever turns of phrases? Or the writer who hits the right tone of voice to trigger emotional responses in your potential customers/clients so they buy, sign up, etc.?</p><h2>How do I find the perfect brand tone for a client?</h2><p>If your client has worked extensively with freelancers and/or in-house writers, they’re likely to have brand voice guidelines or style guides.</p><p>This certainly makes your job easier. The assumption is that your client has done their due diligence, knows their customers/clients inside out, and they know what tone of voice works.&nbsp;</p><p>However, you may have a client who hasn’t done any in-depth research on the correct tone of voice. Worse still, you may have a client who is making huge assumptions about their customers/clients that are wrong.</p><p>Whether you like it or not, this will impact how well your content performs. You could write the best content in the world, but if the tone of voice is off, it will fall flat as it won’t resonate with the audience.</p><p>Ask the following questions to your new client to build a style guide:</p><ol><li><p>What business challenges do you currently have?</p></li></ol><p>This question helps you understand if the current brand tone of voice is correct or not.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if your client says they need more leads but have a high conversion rate, you know the issue is with reach and not tone. When people discover their products/services, they’re ‘sold.’ They resonate with the message and take positive action.</p><p>However, if your client says they need more leads but have a low conversion rate, it means something is off. They don’t need more leads. They need to convert more of their existing leads. One reason could be an issue with the brand tone of voice with the existing content.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Which businesses do you consider your competitors?</p></li></ol><p>This question allows you to see what others are doing and the tone of voice they are using that could be working for them.</p><p>Direct competitors are businesses that have the same target audience as your client. If you discover that a competitor has a lion’s share of the market, it’s common sense to analyze the tone of voice their content is taking. Success leaves clues!</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p>If your target audience was one person, who are they? Describe them to me.</p></li></ol><p>This is a clever way to get your client to focus.</p><p>If you asked, “Who is your target audience,” you may get generic answers, such as middle managers, which is too broad.&nbsp;</p><p>By asking your client to distill their audience down to one person, you will get specifics, such as age, gender, likes/dislikes, etc. The best writers will drill down much further, such as what publications/websites they read, what they do in their spare time, etc., to refine the tone of voice they should use when writing.</p><p>Think of how easy it is to write an email to your best friend. You know their personality, their likes and dislikes, and you know what offends them and what doesn’t. If you’re able to get to this level, that’s when your writing will resonate deeply.</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p>What do you want your potential customers/clients to do?</p></li></ol><p>Remember, even ‘soft’ content that is not directly selling something still has a commercial aspect to it. No business is willing to spend money with zero return on investment.</p><p>You need to find out what your client wants their audience to do overall (very likely to be a monetary transaction) and also the smaller action steps for different content pieces. E.g., signing up to get a free sample/report, upgrading product after initial purchase, etc.</p><h2>What are the main brand voice tones for businesses?</h2><p>There are numerous words to describe tone. For example, passionate, dry, bold, down-to-earth, informative, etc.</p><p>But ultimately, all business content falls into five tone of voice types:</p><ol><li><p>Energetic</p></li><li><p>Dependable</p></li><li><p>Elegant/Expensive</p></li><li><p>Irreverent</p></li><li><p>Innovative</p></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Understanding which of the five your client’s audience falls into will make or break your content.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Let’s look at some examples using the five tone of voice types.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem; font-weight: bold;\">Energetic</span><br></p><p>This is a good tone of voice to hit if your client’s ideal customers/clients are in the youth market (e.g. teen clothes, ‘young’ social media networks and apps, etc.)&nbsp;</p><p>It also works well in markets designed to utilize energy, such as gyms, sports clothing, exercise programs, etc.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.3125rem; font-weight: bold;\">How to hit an energetic brand tone</span><br></p><p>An energetic style guide uses lots of bullet-pointed or numbered lists. Don’t use long sentences with a ton of conjunctions.</p><p></p><p>Fragmented sentence structure with a motivating tone works well.</p><p>Also, use short words for a brand voice that packs a punch.</p><p>Here’s a great energetic tone of voice example:</p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout\"><u>https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout</u></a><u>. </u>Can you see how the brand\'s voice has a \'go-getter\' personality with a motivating tone throughout?</p><h3>Dependable</h3><p>This is the perfect tone of voice when your client’s products/services are something that their clients/customers rely on.</p><p></p><p>The product or service may not be the most exciting, but people value these products or services for their dependability over excitement.</p><p>Great examples are insurance companies, payment/merchant service providers, hosting companies, etc.</p><p>This doesn’t mean your words can’t inject a little energy or humor. But keep in mind that the audience is ultimately looking for safety. &nbsp;Use a more formal tone of voice.</p><h4>How to hit a dependable brand tone</h4><p>A dependable style guide uses words that are wholesome and feel comfortable and warm.&nbsp;At the same time, you want a slightly authoritative tone of voice.</p><p>More so than any other tone type, avoid using any words that can offend, such as curse words. This will likely go against brand values. This is not the audience to be ‘edgy’ with. Avoid using slang or colloquialisms for the same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a good dependable tone of voice example:</p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/\"><u>https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/</u></a>. Check out the respectful tone and writing style throughout.</p><h3>Elegant/Expensive</h3><p>This is the must-use tone of voice for high-end items, boutiques, or any product or service that’s targeted at the affluent. It’s also an ideal tone of voice for salons, spas, and resorts.</p><h4>How to hit an elegant and expensive brand tone</h4><p>An elegant and expensive style guide uses a longer sentence structure that flows well with conjunctions.</p><p></p><p>Use adjectives to create a world inside the reader’s mind so they can imagine the pleasure. Keep content about the functional aspect of a product or service to a minimum.</p><p>Avoid using action-oriented words and short, punchy sentences. Nothing in your content should convey that there is a rush.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at this example of an elegant/expensive brand tone of voice:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Take a look at the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.joali.com/\"><u>https://www.joali.com/</u></a>&nbsp;to see the brand\'s tone and brand personality that oozes luxury and elegance.</p><h3>Irreverent</h3><p>This is a humorous tone of voice for businesses and brands who want to be seen as ‘out of the box’ thinkers.</p><p>Therefore, it lends itself to apps and games targeted at the youth (especially males) as well as street brands.</p><p>However, irreverent, offbeat humor can be used for all kinds of products and services - it’s all about knowing your audience.</p><h4>How to hit an irreverent brand tone</h4><p>According to Merriam-Webster, irreverent means “lacking proper respect or seriousness.”</p><p>However, you need to understand the audience to know what they like to disrespect - it’s not a case of just disrespecting anything and everything! Therefore, hitting the right irreverent tone of voice is a bit harder than other tones.</p><p>Your client needs to give you lots of tone of voice guidelines regarding their perfect customers/clients. so you can assess personality traits, word choice, and communication style.</p><p>Here’s one of the best irreverent tone of voice examples for a … wait for it… life insurance company called Dead Happy!</p><p>Check out the unique tone of the entire content piece at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://deadhappy.com/\"><u>https://deadhappy.com/</u></a>. We\'re sure you\'ll agree. It\'s a very unique brand voice with a clear tone and very distinct personality.</p><p>As you can see with this example, this flies against the earlier advice that insurance companies should go for a more dependable tone.</p><p>However, the reason why this content works so well is that the business knows its audience (young, upwardly mobile, and savvy, who love dark humor). They are able to show off the brand\'s personality with offbeat humor.</p><h3>Innovative</h3><p>It will come as no surprise that this tone of voice is perfect for software companies, app firms, and any product/service which is cutting edge.&nbsp;</p><p>If your client can succinctly tell you that “no one is doing exactly what we’re doing” when you ask about their competitors, you know you have an innovative brand.</p><p>That doesn’t mean they don’t have competitors at all. But they will have major differentiation points.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to hit an innovative brand tone</h4><p>Innovative people tend to use fewer words. So keep your content succinct.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, don’t be overly formal. Think of how we became accustomed to seeing Steve Jobs in jeans.

This article will familiarize you with the different copywriter salary ranges. But before getting into copywriting, you have to ask yourself whether an average copywriting salary can replace the primary income from your regular job.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>How much do copywriters make?</p></li><li><p>What level of copywriter salary can you expect to earn with your present copywriting skills?</p></li><li><p>And, ultimately, will it pay the bills?</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">With this in mind, it’ll be best if you set your income goals. Do you want your sole income to come from copywriting, or do you want to look at your copywriting salary as a side income?</span><br></p><p>Copywriting salaries differ from country to country. You have to be realistic and determine the average income a copywriter can make in the country where you would be working.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">What are the average copywriter salaries in different countries?</strong><br></p><p>Let’s look at the average copywriting salaries in the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that several other factors affect copywriter salaries, such as the size of the company a copywriter is working for, whether they’re a junior copywriter or senior copywriter, the location of the company in the country itself, and the industry the copywriter is engaged in.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">How much do copywriters make in the USA?</strong><br></p><p>Copywriters in the US can expect a base salary of $69,450. You can expect an additional cash compensation of $5,000, which takes the total to $74,450.&nbsp;</p><p>However, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the hourly rate for the lowest, medium, and highest copywriter categories is $15 an hour, $30 an hour, and $55 an hour, respectively. This means the highest copywriter salary is $121,600 a year, the medium of $62,000 a year, and the lowest is $31,700 a year.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">How much do copywriters make in the UK?&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>The average salary of a copywriter is lower in the UK compared to the copywriter salaries in the US, starting from a low of £25,000 for junior copywriters and £30,000 for medium-level copywriters. Senior copywriters can expect to make around £45,000 or more.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">How much do copywriters make in Australia?</strong><br></p><p>Copywriters in Australia have higher average salaries than their counterparts in the US and UK. A junior copywriter can expect an average salary of $76,000 a year. The medium-level copywriters make around $87,000 annually, while the senior copywriters earn an average of $122,000. The copywriter\'s salaries are also subject to location and industry.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">How much do copywriters make in Canada?</strong><br></p><p>A junior copywriter in Canada with less than one year of experience can expect an annual salary of C$41,000. A medium-level copywriter can expect to earn C$57,000, while a senior copywriter can earn up to C$105,000. All these averages include tips, bonuses, and overtime pay.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">Do copywriters in different branches and locations have different salaries?</strong><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Copywriter salary by location</strong><br></p><p>Now that you’re familiar with the copywriter salaries you may expect, it’s time to find out your earning potential in different fields of copywriting.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’re a \'write for fun\' type of copywriter or a workaholic copywriter, how much you earn will greatly impact your life.&nbsp;</p><p>The two main factors responsible for a copywriter\'s salary difference are location and experience.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a junior copywriter in a big city like New York can make $61,000 a year on average. In contrast, a junior copywriter in a smaller city will earn $42,000 a year.</p><p>At the same time, a senior copywriter in New York will make $93,000 a year, and if the same copywriter is based in a smaller city, he will earn $65,000 a year on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at these numbers, you can understand that a copywriter\'s salary in a small town is in a comfortable range, while in a bigger city, it’s a lucrative one (although living in a big city is more expensive).&nbsp;</p><p>However, with the increase in remote working, the lines have blurred, and a copywriter can expect a good, big-city salary and still work wherever he wishes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Copywriter salary by different branches</strong><br></p><p>As a copywriter, you can be one of these three:</p><ul><li><p>Agency copywriter</p></li><li><p>In-house copywriter</p></li><li><p>Freelance copywriter&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Copywriters usually start by working with an agency for a couple of years. They then move on to being an in-house copywriter. Later, when they have more experience, they may branch out on their own and work as a freelancer or have their own agency.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.3125rem;\">Agency copywriter salary</strong><br></p><p>Marketing and advertising agencies offer a great place to network and learn on the job. You can expect a good entry-level copywriter salary if you work for a competitive, successful agency.&nbsp;</p><p>The average salary for a junior copywriter is $47,000, and a senior copywriter working for an agency can expect an average salary of $88,000 (both estimates are for the US).</p><p>There isn\'t much data on average senior copywriter salaries because copywriters rarely stay long enough with an agency to reach seniority levels.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">In-house copywriter salary</strong><br></p><p>Working as an in-house copywriter offers mid-career salaries. In-house copywriters usually move towards marketing. You can position yourself to get lucrative offers from competing firms for your skills.&nbsp;</p><p>These days it is in the copywriter\'s best interests to move jobs to increase their salaries, as there are few chances of getting more than a couple of promotions. Also, the business you’re working for as an in-house copywriter won\'t think twice about letting you go for their financial benefit if they need to.</p><p>If you want a steady, long-term paycheck and you’re not ambitious enough to freelance or have your own agency, being an in-house copywriter could be the best job for you.</p><p>For the US, the average salary of a junior copywriter is $48,000 a year, and a senior copywriter can expect to make $85,000 a year.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Freelance copywriter salary</strong><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">The possibility of remote work has made freelance copywriting more doable for copywriters. It’s ideal for a freelance copywriter to work at an agency initially to make contacts and gain experience. Freelancing may offer the highest pay with the least work for a copywriter.</span><br></p><p>But it’s best to remember that once you decide to freelance, you are on your own. There are no healthcare benefits, you have to pay full taxes, and no 401K matching/retirement contributions.</p><p>A freelance copywriter’s salary is not dependent on a copywriter\'s junior or senior level. It depends on how many products/services you can sell your copy.</p><p>While entry-level freelance copywriters struggle to make $20,000 a year, seasoned copywriters have been known to scale around $150,000 a year and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">Do copywriters of different content types have different salaries?</strong><br></p><p>Copywriter salaries depend on the content type you specialize in.</p><h3><strong>Email copywriter</strong></h3><p>Email copywriters are in high demand because email is a simple electronic letter that has the potential to turn into a marketing powerhouse.&nbsp;</p><p>Email is an exciting platform for a firm\'s content marketing strategies. This attracts lucrative salaries for email copywriters. The average salary for a copywriter with email marketing skills in the US is around $56,000 a year.&nbsp;</p><p>With a great ROI of $38 for every dollar spent, many businesses have started investing in email marketing. It’s why the average cost for email marketing ranges from $200 to $2000 per email.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Social media copywriter</strong><br></p><p>The field of social media copywriting is a rapidly evolving one. Each social media channel\'s algorithm keeps changing, and with it, the content.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that a social media copywriter has to continuously upgrade their content style and knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The average salary of a social media copywriter in the US is $50,000 a year or $25 an hour. Entry-level copywriters can expect $44,000 a year, and those with 3 to 4 years of experience can expect $70,000 a year.</p><p>Social media copywriters usually upgrade their jobs to marketing director positions, where they can expect an average salary range of $90,000 to $120,000 a year.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Blogger</strong><br></p><p>Copywriters who write blogs have a wide-ranging pay scale. The average total compensation of a blogger depends on how they blog to earn money. Copywriters who are full-time business bloggers earn an average salary of $64,000 a year.&nbsp;</p><p>Owners of blogs, who are just starting, may earn a modest $200 to $2500 per month. Professional bloggers who use monetization strategies for their blog can expect an average salary of $15,000 a month or more. Therefore, blogging can be a high-paying industry.</p><p>Once you dip your toes in this copywriting niche, you’ll find yourself swimming in a warm, welcoming ocean of opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">Is copywriting for you?&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>You’ve now become familiar with the common copywriter salaries and how they’re dependent on the copywriting type, the location you are based, and the industry you’re in.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you dive into the vast field of copywriting, it’s in your best interests to crunch the numbers and set your income goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to earn six figures, or are you just looking for a side income?&nbsp;</p><p>Copywriting is suitable for every income goal, but you need to decide what that goal is and act accordingly.</p><p>Take action, explore high-paying copywriting jobs, and start your career as a professional copywriter.&nbsp;</p></div><p><ul></ul></p><p><br><br></p>', 'Professional copywriters are in great demand in copywriting, and you have a huge market as a playing field.', '', '', 'Copywriter', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, NULL, '2023-01-07 11:08:38', '2023-01-25 08:38:35'),

Computers allow us to write, edit, format, and rearrange content.&nbsp;</p><p>With ongoing digitalization, we have modern writing apps, writing tools, and software that provide the writer hassle-free functionality.</p><p>Many writers love Apple iOS devices and use apps on the iPhone or iPad to help them write. Some of these writing apps have features that include distraction-free writing. It\'s worth mentioning apps like Final Draft and Scrivener, which are perfect for users who need an easy-to-use, simple text editor or word processor.&nbsp;</p><p>As a beginner writer, you can start with Pages (free) or Word ($70 per year subscription) as a beginner. But, if you take your writing seriously, you\'ll want to graduate from this. So, let\'s look at some great writing apps you can use on your Apple iPad device to support your writing and help you create your next article, blog, or even novel.</p><h2><strong>What you should know about writing tools</strong></h2><p>Before you begin with any of the suggested apps, consider the following:</p><h3><strong>What do you plan to write?</strong></h3><p>There are five aspects to consider:</p><ul><li><p>Fiction or nonfiction</p></li><li><p>Prose or Poetry</p></li><li><p>Long-form or short form</p></li><li><p>Writing platform (print or web)</p></li><li><p>Leisure writing or professional writing</p></li></ul><p>The types of writing you plan to do influence your choice of app.</p><h3><strong>The 5 different stages involved in writing</strong></h3><p>Most writing projects involve five distinct steps. While some apps target some of these steps, others focus on all five stages.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prewriting</strong></p></li></ol><p>This includes topic selection, research, brainstorming, and planning what you need to write. This crucial first step allows you to collect and arrange your thoughts.&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>First Draft</strong></p></li></ol><p>The first draft of your writing doesn\'t need to be perfect and will likely be different from your final write-up. Your primary focus here should be writing without distraction or being unsure about yourself.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Revision</strong></p></li></ol><p>This takes your first draft to the next level, where you add, remove, and rearrange content and structure. It involves improving the words, clarifying the vague content, and removing unnecessary text.</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Editing</strong></p></li></ol><p>This is fine-tuning your writing, including spelling, punctuation, and grammar corrections, checking for clarity and enhancing the text. This is an important step, especially with professional writing. A professional editor may use a separate app for tracking edits and making suggested changes.</p><ol start=\"5\"><li><p><strong>Publishing&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol><p>Publishing can be in two mediums, print or web. Some apps have settings that allow the writer to post on several web platforms directly, create ebooks, or develop and download fully-formatted PDFs.</p><h3><strong>Word processors do not allow you to separate style from content</strong></h3><p>Many writers use word processors for their writing projects. But be aware that these are not the best tools for professional writing projects.</p><p>Word processors are not designed for composition. Word processors were mainly intended for business use. As such, a lot of emphases is placed on presentational elements.</p><p>It\'s why Word or Google Docs start to format your work, typeset your text, etc., immediately.</p><p>Many of the features in a word processor cause distraction. They don\'t allow you to focus on ideas generation and the creation of words. Your mind is diverted to the final document. This is a big, time-wasting problem.</p><p>A writer\'s main purpose is to write. Anything else is a distraction. Though all the features provided may be useful later in the editing and publishing steps, initially, they will hinder your writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro writing apps are different and focus on helping the writer to write. Once the writing process starts, they allow formatting and style to get in the way. Any extra features that may be useful to writers at a later stage can stay out until needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now let\'s look at the six best writing apps we\'ve reviewed for the iPad. We\'ll list the pros, cons, and pricing for each. Remember to use the above points to help you decide which app is best for you.</p><h2><strong>The 6 Best Writing Apps for the iPad&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>#1 Ulysses</strong></h3><p>This is a simple text editor that hides a lot of power.

It\'s designed for long-form content, such as books, academic papers, etc.</p><p>As you progress, you can organize and rearrange your chapters, topics, etc. (very difficult to do in Word or Pages).</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Allows you to set writing targets for your entire book project or just for a current session</p></li><li><p>Store research, e.g., drafts, notes, web links, images, PDFs, videos, audio files, etc., in your book</p></li><li><p>Quick access to everything you need</p></li><li><p>Built-in spelling and grammar checks</p></li><li><p>Polish your writing and prepare it for book printing or sending to publishers.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Learning basics takes some time as a beginner</p></li><li><p>Freezes at times, and takes a while to backup</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p><p>For Mac, Scrivener costs $49 (one-time fee).</p><h3><strong>#3 OmniOutliner</strong></h3><p>As the name suggests, this is an \'outlining\' tool. Its main element is to help in expanding ideas. It\'s exceptional in outlining everything from novels to non-fiction books.</p><p>This app allows you to jot down thoughts and then helps you arrange, elaborate, manage, and grow them until your work is complete. It\'s ideal for bloggers, video creators, and freelance writers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Easy to learn and use</p></li><li><p>Well-designed interface</p></li><li><p>Variety of easy-to-use templates</p></li><li><p>Keyword filtering</p></li><li><p>Mind mapping tool</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>No feature for internal PDF export</p></li><li><p>Full-feature software is expensive compared to other apps</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p><p>Available for both Mac and iOS, OmniOutliner is $99 on either platform (the stripped-down OmniOutliner Essentials costs $19.99).</p><h3><strong>#4 Drafts 5</strong></h3><p>One of the most basic note-taking apps, Drafts 5 allows you to speed up your composition and writing work. Whether you\'re a beginner or a seasoned writer, you can start composing and writing fast.</p><p>Once the text is ready, the app can publish it as a blog post on your website, an email, or various other actions in just a tap.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Easy to use and cost-effective</p></li><li><p>Transcribes from video and audio content</p></li><li><p>Great user support</p></li><li><p>Regular updates</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Freezes when sharing large files</p></li><li><p>Simplify feature can sometimes delete important information</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p><p>Drafts 5 is free to use, while Drafts Pro subscription is $20 per year.</p><h3><strong>#5 iA Writer</strong></h3><p>This helps you stay focused and clarify your message.&nbsp; Even before Mac introduced its Focus Mode, iA Writer already had this unique feature.</p><p>A unique feature is the ability to have all your writing fade to grey, except the sentence you are working on. This takes distraction-free writing to the next level.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Inexpensive</p></li><li><p>Next level distraction-free design</p></li><li><p>Option to highlight superfluous adjectives, weak verbs, and repetitions for improving your writing</p></li><li><p>Supports Markdown formatting with plain text commands right in the text</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>No templates available</p></li><li><p>Limited tools for organizing and arranging files</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p><p>For Mac, the cost is $29.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">#6 Final Draft</strong><br></p><p>Despite many new competitors, this screenwriting app remains the leading choice for television and film writers. Although Final Draft is a word processing app used for letters and prose, its strength lies in its ability to automate screenwriting formats.&nbsp;</p><p>The settings in Final Draft help you concentrate on your storyline, characters, and dialogues by automatically formatting as you write!</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Crafted for screenwriters</p></li><li><p>Easy to use</p></li><li><p>Availability of extensive developmental tools</p></li><li><p>Different types of writing templates are available</p></li><li><p>Instant formatting as per industry standards</p></li><li><p>Supports real-time collaboration with other writers</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>Expensive in comparison to other software</p><p>Collaboration with other writers can only be done one person at a time</p><p>Must sign in to the platform to work from there</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>A professional writing app is probably unnecessary if you\'re just starting your writing journey. Try using an app that serves your writing purpose and the one you\'re comfortable with. This will allow you to focus on your writing rather than getting to grips with an app.</p><p>A word processor like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Apple Pages can be all you need. If you have a device like a Mac or iPad, you can opt for a note-taking app like Apple Notes, Evernote, or your preferred text editor.</p><p>But suppose you\'re a professional writer or serious about writing in a particular field. In that case, spending your valued time and money on an online app designed specifically for your purposes is wise. Most of the apps on our list have a trial version.</p><p>The money you spend and the time you invest getting to grips with a new online writing app will be returned many times as you learn to compose and write content fast and efficiently.</p>', 'In the past, writers and authors had to document their thoughts through pen and paper, styluses on clay pads, typewriters, and other writing tools.', '', '', 'Writing Apps', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, NULL, '2023-01-08 12:08:34', '2023-01-25 08:49:38');

You can improve the content for content marketing by paying attention to the following:</p><ul><li><p>Content should be fresh and useful for humans (and not just geared towards search engines).</p></li><li><p>Use competitive keywords and keyword phrases (and don’t stuff keywords).</p></li><li><p>Put the relevant keywords in your headline.</p></li><li><p>Make your headline readable from an SEO perspective.</p></li><li><p>Understand the user intent of your readers and target them.</p></li><li><p>Blog posts should be longer than 1000 words.</p></li><li><p>Write content that understands and solves the problem of your readers.</p></li><li><p>Write a compelling introduction that draws the reader in and makes them want to stay on the page.</p></li><li><p>Optimize your SEO copy by downloading a WordPress plugin called Yoast SEO. It will help you to get a site ranked higher on Google if you follow its prompts.</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: bolder; color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">4. Meta Title and Meta Description</span><br></p><p>The role of meta description is to help search engines understand the content. A meta description is used by Google as a snippet. The snippet copy will help search engine users to see if the page is relevant to their search query.</p><p>The role of meta description is to help search engines understand the content. A meta description is used by Google as a snippet. The snippet copy will help search engine users to see if the page is relevant to their search query.</p><p>If you want to rank high on Google and catch people’s attention, follow this checklist for writing a meta description:</p><ul><li><p>Make sure the keyword intent behind your keywords is correct. The intent of your client\'s business should be clear in the keywords.</p></li><li><p>Keep your meta description under 150 characters (including spaces).</p></li><li><p>For mobiles, keep it under 113 characters (remember, more searches are done on mobile than any other device, so it\'s best to optimize for mobile over anything else).</p></li><li><p>Along with a short description, include a call to action.</p></li><li><p>Target keywords should be included (they will be bolded in a query and help the page rank).</p></li><li><p>Your meta description should be unique to the page.</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem; font-weight: bolder;\">5. Frequency of targeted keywords</span></p><p>The number of times specific keywords appear on the page determines the keyword frequency.</p><p>In recent times keyword frequency has lost a lot of its importance due to changes in the Google algorithm, but it still stands in the top 200 ranking factors.</p><p>It\'s best to avoid having a keyword density of more than 5.5%. Doing so will flag your blog posts as \'spammy\' to Google and other search engines, which means they could penalise it.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bolder; color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">6. Links</span></p><p>The building blocks of a web page are links. Link building will help a website rank higher in Google searches and increase search volume. Here are the types of links useful for SEO copy:</p><ul><li><p>Internal page links that link to more useful, relevant content.</p></li><li><p>Links to social media platforms to give Google relevancy and social clues (google pays attention to social media marketing)</p></li><li><p>External page links show you value other people’s content.</p></li></ul><p>The primary mission of search engines like Google is to organize all the online information in the world. Links help search engines understand the content marketing strategy so they can send the best visitors to your site.</p><p>However, to be successful in link building, you need to make sure your content creation is focused on human users first and search engines second.</p><p>For example, internal links to other existing content on the site are a great idea, but only if they\'re relevant. Don\'t just link to any page for the sake of it.</p><p>Linking to external sites is a great way to show Google the intent of your content. However, you should not link to any site you find.</p><p>Some sites are \'low value\' in Google\'s eyes as they\'re spammy or \'thin\' on content that humans want to read. Linking to sites like these will not help you\'re standing with Google. In fact, it could even harm your Google ranking.</p><p>Stick to well-established, authority sites. Ideal sites to link to are those that end with .gov, .edu, or .edu.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">What are the different approaches to SEO copywriting?</strong></p><p><strong>Write useful content</strong></p><p>One of the best SEO copywriting tips is to write useful content for human that is also great SEO content. There is no other way around it. People love good and useful content that flows naturally and are likelier to stick to your blog post if they find it interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than mere keyword stuffing, this is the best way to generate leads for your brand. Studies have proven that along with being useful, content should have these four features:</p><ol><li><p>Write high-quality content that is fresh (don\'t regurgitate information that\'s already out there, give it a fresh spin).</p></li><li><p>Optimize your content with well-researched keywords where you\'ve studied keyword intent.</p></li><li><p>Gain sufficient, relevant backlinks (this is where other sites link to your site).&nbsp;</p><p></p></li></ol><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Use keyword research and search intent.</strong><br></p><p>Keyword research is an important aspect of the approach to SEO copywriting. Along with keyword research, you should also be aware of its intent. Before you solve your target audience\'s problems, you should know what the keyword used stands for and whether it fulfils the search intent of viewers.</p><p>Pay attention to the classification of keywords also. There are generally two types of keywords:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Informational keywords are used by people who want to search for useful information for free without paying for it. They are generally how-to words. People using these keywords are generally not buyers. It\'s best to use these keywords in your title tags to cultivate an audience, guide them to your brand, and encourage them to buy a product or service.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Commercial keywords are used by people when they intend to buy something. They are used by the searcher when they are desperate to take action to buy a product. Some examples of commercial intent keywords are review, buy, order, free, comparison, best, fast, etc. The person who is searching with a commercial keyword usually wants to buy a product, or they may sign up for an email that will lead them to convert as buyers.</p></li></ul><p>Here are the three steps to using a target keyword in your copy:</p><ol><li><p>Use the target keyword in the title.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Use alternative keywords in the meta description as well as in your introduction.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Write the content naturally for human readers and keep an eye on keyword density (don\'t stuff keywords)</p></li><li><p>Write the conclusion with the primary keyword inside.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem;\">Use long-tail keywords and short-tail keywords</strong><br></p><p>Short-tail keywords are three words or less, while long-tail keywords are more than three words. SEO firms use long-tail keywords to get your page to the top of search engine results.</p><p>The advantage of using long-tail keywords is that as they grow longer, the search volume gets lower but more specific or relevant.</p><p>For example, if someone searches for \'Ford Ka,\' they could be looking to buy a car, or they are just looking for information. If you\'re writing for a car dealership, someone just searching for \'Ford Ka\' does not mean they want to buy a car. Even if they do, they could be hundreds of miles away.</p><p>Now, if someone searches for \'Ford Ka in Birmingham, UK,\' that\'s far more relevant. Yes, there will be far fewer searches than \'Ford Ka,\' but those searchers will be far more relevant to your car dealership client. Quality of searches trump quantity from a commercial point of view.</p><p>Therefore, long-tail keywords have higher conversion rates than short-tail keywords. They are highly recommended by WordPress plugins like Yoast SEO.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Use storytelling</strong></h3><p>Stories have eternally been loved by humans. As an SEO copywriter, if you can weave your client\'s brand story into your content, viewers will find it more appealing. They are more likely to stick through to the end of the blog post and more likely to push the call-to-action button.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the element of storytelling in a natural way and use high-quality content to make the maximum impact on your reader. The Lego Movie is a successful brand story. It does not just sell Lego bricks. It sells possibilities.&nbsp;</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>Case studies</strong></h3><p>Case studies help to explain your products and services. They help to drive more organic traffic to your site, and are therefore highly useful. Studies have shown that B2B buyers prefer research-based content and case studies.&nbsp;</p><p>The different types of case studies are:</p><ul><li><p>Research reports and studies.</p></li><li><p>Technical spec sheets and data sheets.</p></li><li><p>Analyst intelligence and insight.</p></li><li><p>White papers.</p></li><li><p>Articles on trade publishing.</p></li></ul><p>Your main long tail keywords will start showing up on the top Google rankings once you start writing consistent and detailed case studies consistently.</p><p><strong style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem;\">Benefits of SEO copywriting</strong><br></p><p>What are the benefits of great SEO content and SEO copywriting?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Most people only click on the first two to three search results when searching on Google. Good SEO content that is pleasing to both humans and Google will mean your client\'s website will rank higher than a competitor\'s website, and hopefully get into those top search results.</p></li><li><p>Great content creation that\'s based on good SEO copywriting principles and search intent will gain valuable and qualified traffic to your target site. Remember to use focus keywords in title tags and meta descriptions in your writing process.</p></li><li><p>If you write content that provides useful information to your audience by answering their questions and providing a solution to their problems, you\'ll create trust which leads to sales and brand loyalty.</p></li><li><p>You can inspire your readers to take action, e.g., to buy your product, subscribe to the blog, listen to the podcast, etc.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can gain authority over time through link building as other sites link to your content when relevant.</p></li><li><p>A great SEO strategy will not only benefit you in terms of search engine optimisation, but you\'ll find it benefits other digital marketing forms, such as social media marketing.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Writing content that\'s optimized for both humans and search engines is the biggest challenge that content marketers face.</p><p>Writing smarter content is the key to building your blog audience. SEO copywriting is not difficult so long as you remember that you need to write for people and not just search engines. It\'s all about:</p><ul><li><p>Understanding the target audience so you\'re clear on search terms and search intent.</p></li><li><p>Using a focus keyword and then creating relevant short tail and long tail keywords.</p></li><li><p>Using your content to answer questions and solve problems for your reader.</p></li><li><p>Using things like incoming links, title tags, meta descriptions, etc. to signpost to Google without disrupting the human experience (keep it relevant).</p></li></ul><p>Just follow the above principles of successful SEO copywriting to create high-ranking web content that excites people to buy your clients\' products and services and take their site to the first page of Google.&nbsp;</p>', 'As a writer, are you tasked with helping a client\'s website appear at the top of search engine rankings?

It\'s called a swipe file because it\'s the ideal place to \'swipe\' some inspiration when you\'re struck with writer\'s block.</span></p><p><span data-color=\"rgb(250, 250, 250)\" style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250)\">Create a folder where you can bookmark great sales pages, landing pages, blog posts or adverts as and when you discover them online. Create a folder in your email inbox to save great emails that made you take action of some sort.

Perhaps you remember revising for exams when you were in school. We bet you couldn\'t just read a textbook and expect to do well. In most cases, revising involves writing. The act of writing helps you to remember.</span></p><p><span data-color=\"rgb(250, 250, 250)\" style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250)\">Some proponents of this tactic insist on writing copy with pen and paper.

However, please be aware that they will already have many agency copywriters on their books. This doesn\'t mean you won\'t get work from them. If they\'re a growing agency, where demand is outstripping capacity, they could still send you lots of work.

Having the right tools can help immensely, which is why we compiled this list of the best tablets for writers. In our opinion, a great tablet will not only help you to write efficiently but also do multiple tasks related to writing.</p><p>Finding the best writing tablet to fulfill your needs is not a difficult task if you know what your needs are.</p><h3>A familiar operating system</h3><p>Why spend time learning how to use Microsoft Surface tablets or a Samsung Galaxy Tab if you\'re used to using an Apple iPad Pro or vice versa?</p><h3>Screen size versus portability</h3><p>The smaller the screen size, the more portable the device. But too small a screen size, and it becomes difficult to work on for long periods, even with great screen quality.</p><h3>Battery life</h3><p>This is important depending on your lifestyle. If you plan on writing mainly when you\'re out and about, it can be infuriating if you run out of power. The best writing tablet for you would be one with longer battery life.</p><h3>Storage space</h3><p><p></p></p><p>If you\'re likely to have a lot of Apple or Android apps, you need a good tablet with a decent storage</p>', 'When you\'re in the middle of your creative flow and inspired to write, a great writing tablet to hand is a must.', '', '', 'Copywriter', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, NULL, '2023-01-08 12:27:24', '2023-01-25 08:32:12');

Many content marketers spend considerable time working on the blog content as it remains an important aspect of their content marketing.</p><p>However, many blog writers don\'t spend enough time on creating the best blog post titles.</p><p>This is a huge mistake for two reasons.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>The blog title or blog headline is the very beginning of a content piece. Therefore it\'s the first thing that draw readers in to read your blog article. If it\'s not a great title, there\'s no point in writing the rest of the blog article as nobody is going to go beyond the blog post title to read it.</p><p>A reader may never even get to your article if your title is bad. They\'ll see the title in their Google search, ignore it, and click on another article. You need compelling headlines with trigger words that make a reader feel, \"I need to read this\" to get a high click through rate.</p></li><li><p>Search engines use your blog post title as an indicator of relevancy. The best blog post titles, perhaps with a trigger word, lets Google and other search engines know that your content is relevant. Great blog titles will help a site rank well on search engine results pages.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>So let\'s look at a few ideas on how to create the best and most catchy blog post titles to increase your click-through rates.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>The beginner\'s guide to catchy blog post titles</h2><p>Here\'s our step by step guide to creating the best blog post titles for your content marketing, that grab the attention of both your target audience and search engines.</p><ul><li><h3>Curiosity-based headlines</h3></li></ul><p>Make sure your blog title includes a sense of need or want for your target readers. They should be eager to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the blog post title for this blog post is How to Write the Perfect Blog Post Title (including examples).</p><p>Writers know they need to write great blog titles or blog headlines for their blog posts to have a great click through rate. Anything that shows them how to do it well will make them want to read further. Even experienced writers will want to check that there are no new tips that they\'ve missed.</p><p>Also, using \'including examples\' raises curiosity further as it implies that the \'good stuff\' is right there inside the article or blog post. <br></p><ul><li><h3>Deliver your promise</h3></li></ul><p>There\'s nothing worse than raising curiosity only to not deliver on the promise.</p><p>Writers who focus solely on click through rate (i.e. making an article look great enough to click on when someone searches on Google) without delivering can be penalized by Google as it measures how long people stay on a site.</p><p>If most of your visitors click to read your article but then disappear fast, it signifies to Google that your content is either irrelevant or poor.</p><p>Imagine how you would feel after reading \'How to Write the Perfect Blog Post Title (including examples)\' and then there are no examples or tips.</p><p>People tend to scan content instead of reading from top to bottom. They need to see that the blog content delivers on the promise made by the blog title.</p><p></p><ul><li><h3>Add emotions to your blog/article title</h3></li></ul><p>Emotions sell, whether they are positive or negative and therefore make intriguing blog post titles.</p><p>For example, instead of writing “7 Things I Do Not Like About Work From Home” you can write “7 Things I Hate About Work From Home and What To Do About Them!”</p><p>By using \'hate,\' you evoke far more emotion than \'do not like.\'</p><p>Notice how the second headline also uses an element of curiosity too by using \'what to do about them,\' implying that the answers are right there inside the blog post or article.</p><ul><li><h3>Give priority to keyword research &amp; search engine optimization</h3></li></ul><p>It\'s prudent to do keyword research and check the number of monthly searches. You can then use this knowledge to strategically place the best keyword into your blog title.</p><p>If someone is likely to type in a particular keyword to see the type of content you write about, seeing those same keywords in your blog title will prove to the that your article is highly relevant to their needs.</p><p>Keep in mind search intent. A short-tail keyword may have higher monthly search numbers, but a long-tail keyword could be more relevant and have lower competition, so your article can rank well on Google and other search engines.</p><ul><li><h3>Keep your blog headlines under 60 characters</h3></li></ul><p>Search engines like Google tend to only show the first 60 characters. Longer blog titles will be cut off - problematic if your main keyword is at the end of your blog title, or the shortened blog title does not make sense.</p><p>Stick to under 60 characters for your blog title, and you can be sure a searcher will see the entire thing.</p><h2>13 Blog Post Title Templates To Increase Your Click Through Rates</h2><p>Let\'s take a look at some tried-and-tested headline examples that grab attention and arouse curiosity.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.53125rem; font-weight: bold;\">1. \'How to….\' blog titles</span></p><p>This is a popular way to create a blog title (we used it here in this article title).</p><p>These blog post titles attract the reader to learn something valuable, mostly a skill they haven\'t yet mastered and need or want to learn.</p><h4><strong>Examples of \'How to...\' headlines:</strong></h4><ul><li><p>How to download YouTube videos&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How to write a resume&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 24.5px; font-weight: 700;\">2. \'X ways to solve Y\' blog titles</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">These blog titles are great for list posts.

For example, coffee mugs with different designs.</p><p></p><ul><li><h3><strong>Shows</strong></h3></li></ul><p>When advertisers want to list the names of TV shows or performances, they can use the show header. For example, Shows: Friends, Slumdog Millionaire, etc.</p><p></p><ul><li><h3><strong>Service catalogs</strong></h3><p>You can list the services your business offers by using the structured snippet header of ‘service catalog.’ This header can be used only for services and not for listing products.

For example, a handyman could list weatherproofing services, home decor services, plumbing services, etc.</p></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><h3><strong>Neighborhoods</strong></h3><p></p></li><li><p>Official city tourism sites usually use this structured snippet to list the neighborhoods in the city.

For example, Model: Prius, Camry, and Corolla are models of the Toyota company.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Insurance coverage</strong></h3></li></ul><p>The ‘insurance coverage’ header highlights specific types of insurance coverage. Here\'s a structured snippet header example from an insurance comparison site. Insurance coverage: Auto, Home, Life, Renters, Two wheelers, etc.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Featured hotels</strong></h3></li></ul><p>Advertisers can showcase specific hotels, which they can then book for their customers through the featured hotel header. This snippet header is used by hotel booking websites and travel agencies to help their customers find hotels and book rooms. The values in this header should be the specific names of hotels. For example, Featured Hotels: Hilton NY, The Park, NY, Marriot, NY, etc.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Destinations</strong></h3></li></ul><p>The destinations header is generally used by airlines, rail companies, and bus operators. The \'destination\' snippet header lists specific places visitors can travel to. It can be cities, states, countries, continents, sites, or attractions. These companies list the destinations the passengers can travel to using their services.</p><p></p><ul><li><h3><strong>Degree programs</strong></h3></li></ul><p>An educational institution, like a college or school, uses the \'degree program\' snippet header to promote specific programs that the institution offers. The list should contain specific degrees like MA or BA. It should not contain any additional information about the degree programs. For example, Degree programs: Accounting, Marketing, Advertising, Taxation, etc.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Courses&nbsp;</strong></h3></li></ul><p>In this \'course\' snippet header, you can list specific classes or courses, such as ‘creative writing’ or ‘public speaking.’. You cannot list degrees like MBA or BA as you should use the degree program snippet header instead.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Brands</strong></h3></li></ul><p>Under the \'brand\' snippet header, you can list specific brands you offer without any additional information or description of the brands and products. You also cant include the number of brands you offer or any defining phrases.&nbsp; For example, if you want to advertise various Dell laptop brands, your header will read, Brands: Inspiron, Alienware, XPS, etc.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Amenities</strong></h3></li></ul><p>The snippet header ‘amenities’ is usually used to highlight the features and facilities a place offers. This header enables hotels, Airbnb, or real estate agents to showcase the amenities they have to offer. This is how Airbnb uses this header, Amenities: WiFi, pet friendly. Laundry facility, etc.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do I optimize structured snippets and boost ad performance?</h2><p><br>You can optimize structured snippets for your digital marketing strategy with these few tips and tricks:</p><ul><li><p>To get the best results and make structured snippets work, focus on matching the search and query intent to the target audience.</p></li><li><p>Add structured snippets to an ad campaign or ad group by pairing them with search queries the snippets will appear for. This will make it easy for them to be found by the search engine.</p></li><li><p>Use the correct format. Complete the list and highlight specific aspects to make it easy for the visitor to understand what products and services your company offers. Double-check to make sure you have compiled everything with the most relevant structured snippet you need.</p></li><li><p>List at least four values per header. This helps to widen the choice base for the visitor and keeps them engaged on your site. This is a crucial part of online advertising.</p></li><li><p>Consider the smartphone or mobile user who uses mobile and tablet devices and is an on-the-go type of customer. More individuals search using mobile devices than desktops or laptops.</p></li><li><p>A crucial step in the SEO process is to capture the attention of potential customers by using an ad extension. You can do this if you create shorter snippets. Optimization of snippets is a must for engaging customers on the go.</p></li><li><p>It\'s a good strategy to have several header value options available. It gives the client more choices, and you may have a more relevant extension to pair with the ad.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>What are dynamic structured snippet extensions?</h2><p>There are multiple structured snippet extensions available. Dynamic structured snippet extensions are extensions that are automatically added to your ad campaigns by Google. Based on the information that google has about your products and services, it will decide which snippets to show and which values to add to your campaign.</p><p>The drawback to this is that Google does not reveal to you the actual snippets they have created. You can only find out what snippets have been created by a chance encounter.</p><p>For this reason, most people turn off dynamic structured snippets extensions.&nbsp;</p><h2>How do I turn off dynamic structured snippet extensions?</h2><p><br>You can turn off structured snippet extensions by following these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Log into your account.</p></li><li><p>Go to the ‘ads and extension’ menu.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to the section called \'automated extensions.\'</p></li><li><p>Click ‘more’ in the top right-hand corner of the page.</p></li><li><p>Choose advanced options.</p></li><li><p>Pick the option, ‘turn off specific automated extensions.’</p></li><li><p>Select ‘dynamic structured snippets’ from the list.</p></li><li><p>Specify the reason for disabling the dynamic structured extension.</p></li><li><p>Click on the ‘turn off’ button to complete the process of turning off structured snippet extensions.</p></li></ol><h2>How do I use Google ad structured extensions?</h2><p>Google Ads structured snippets are used to help people advertise certain aspects of their products and services. They are a type of ad extension.&nbsp;</p><p>The heading of an ad should be below 30 characters, and its description should not be more than 90 characters. To use this feature, follow this process:</p><ul><li><p>Go to Google ads.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Click on \'search campaigns\' and find \'ads.\'</p></li><li><p>Click on \'extensions\'&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Find \'add structured snippet extension\'</p></li><li><p>Once on this page, choose your desired header.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><br>When you add structured snippets to your search ads,&nbsp; you are providing valuable information to your viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow these simple steps on Google and make your ad stand out to your target audience and attract more qualified leads.&nbsp;</p><p>By using the right information in your headers, you can do away with the problem of unnecessary clicks.

New freelancers may even start writing for a content mill without realizing they\'re writing for one.&nbsp;</p><p>Content mills are also known as content farms. These companies depend upon volume sales of mass-produced content.</p><p>The content produced is in the form of articles and blog posts. However, the writers who write this content are paid very low rates. This is because these content farms sell content at very low rates themselves and are looking to make a profit through publishing a ton of content.</p><p>Content mills are generally on the lowest rung of quality in the writing industry. They care only about the quantity of the content and not about the quality.</p><h2>What are the two different types of content mills?</h2><p>Content mills or content farms come in two forms:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Individual websites</strong></p></li></ol><p>These types of content mills produce a large volume from multiple freelance content writers. They work like a writers mill disguised as a job board. Their main goal is to rank their content high on Google and other search engines.</p><p></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Freelance marketplaces</strong></p></li></ol><p>These content marketplaces connect writers who create cheap, low-quality content with independent online publishers.&nbsp;</p><p>Many content mills give themselves the cloak of legitimacy by disguising themselves as freelance marketplace. But, in reality, they exploit writers by paying very low rates for their writing work (as low as 2 cents per word).</p><p>Additionally, most of the writing work is published anonymously. A writer is considered a ghostwriter for these websites.</p><p></p><h2>The journey of the content mill</h2><p>We started to see content mills about 15 years ago. At first, there were the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://guru.com\">guru.com</a> that paid a pittance to writers in lieu of cheap quality content.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, around 10 years ago, the site Content Media was launched by a former MySpace executive. It, too, offered a bare-bones pay rate to writers in return for very cheap quality content. They then stuffed the content with keywords to get high rankings on Google.&nbsp;</p><p>This strategy worked, and content mills clocked in huge returns. But then several crucial updates made by Google to its algorithm put a stop to their dream run.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you have content mills in their new avatar as mass writer platforms. Thankfully, a handful of these upgraded content mills offer pro rates to writers for good quality writing work.&nbsp;</p><h2>The best content mills</h2><p>If you are a beginner and just starting out as a freelance content writer, here are some of the best content writing sites to look into:</p><ul><li><h3>Upwork&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><p>You set your own rates.</p></li><li><p>Hires worldwide.</p></li><li><p>Pays through various payment gateways, including PayPal and direct bank transfers. Once payment is made by the client, you have to wait for 6 days before you can withdraw money.</p></li><li><p>You can find high-paying gigs of freelance writing work through this website. Upwork allows freelance writers to work directly with clients and apply for the jobs of their choice. The fees charged by Upwork are high initially, but as the volume of work increases, the percentage fee comes down to only 5%.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><h3>Constant Content</h3><ul><li><p>You can set your own pricing for articles.</p></li><li><p>Hires worldwide.</p></li><li><p>Pays through PayPal on the first week of every month.</p></li><li><p>Only articles can be listed for sale on this content website. Clients can post orders which can then be fulfilled by the writers.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This site focuses solely on selling articles. The writers keep 65% of the sale price. However, there is no guarantee that your writing work will sell. So first post a few articles and then wait and see. If they\'re not picked up, you can post them elsewhere. The best part about Constant Content is that a writer can set their own rate per article.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><h3>Crowd content</h3><ul><li><p>Pay is $0.012 cents per word for blogs and articles and $1.75 cents per social media post.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Hires from any country where English is the native language.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Pays through PayPal every Tuesday and Friday.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>On Crowd Content, the quality of your application determines your rating. If your rating is high, you get access to higher-paying gigs.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This content writing site offers varied work, such as blogs, articles, technical writing, copywriting, etc.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><h3>Textbroker</h3><ul><li><p>Pays up to 5 cents per word.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Hires from native English-speaking countries.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Payment is through PayPal, but you should have at least $10 in your account.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>To write for this site, you need to have US citizenship or permanent residency. You will be asked for a writing sample. Based on the quality of your sample, you\'re allotted a rating. The higher the rating, the more pay-per-word you\'ll receive.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Problems with content mills&nbsp;as a freelance writer</h2><p><br>Most content mills are full of problems that are not easily spotted by new freelance writers until too late. Here are the problems of getting involved with content mills.</p><p></p><ul><li><h3>Low-quality content</h3></li></ul><p>The only goal of many content mills is to get their content ranked high on Google.</p><p>Content mills generally source writers working at very low pay rates. Because these writers need to write in bulk to make money, there is less focus on quality control, and many will publish badly written copy.</p><p>Most writers of this type of content don\'t do any research and don\'t add their original viewpoint. They just change the order of words or phrases around as they don\'t have time to do a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>This can also lead to plagiarism, which is taking someone else\'s ideas and passing them off as one\'s own.&nbsp;</p><p>Plagiarism is a serious offense. College students can get kicked out of college and many writers out of their job. If you publish plagiarized content on your own website, Google can penalize your ranking. The original content publisher may even sue you as you copied their content.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><h3>Poorly paid freelance writers who become \'stuck\'</h3></li></ul><p>Because of the volume of writing required to make money, writers working for content mills are caught in a vicious cycle. They are barely paid a living wage, so they churn out low-quality content.</p><p>This, in turn, results in a sorry-looking portfolio. High-end clients on the lookout for quality content won\'t bother with hiring these writers. So they\'re stuck working for these content mills as they can\'t find clients independently.&nbsp;</p><p>Many writers are then frustrated, give up on writing and look at other income streams.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a decent income goal of earning $4,000/month, and you are being paid only 2 cents per word by a content mill, you\'ll have to write 200,000 words per month (or 200 blog posts of 1,000 words each).</p><p>Can you write that much? Not if you want to preserve your health and your sanity!</p><p></p><ul><li><h3>Stunted freelance writing career</h3></li></ul><p>If your goal is to become a freelance writer with a thriving freelance business, then working for a content mill is not for you. You can only work as a ghostwriter and remain anonymous. Your content will be considered as mere ghostwritten content. All the credits and the profits from your labor will go to the content mill you\'re working for.</p><p>A freelance writer has to first work at building their portfolio and reputation. Even if you are an experienced writer of 200 articles, you don’t have ownership of those articles. And when you sit down to write an author bio, you\'ll have nothing to show.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to earn good bucks as a legitimate freelance writer, you have to build authority and show evidence of your expertise as a professional writer.</p><p>When you write for a content mill, you\'re writing purely for SEO, which means you are basically writing for an algorithm. You\'re not writing to inspire people or to showcase your creative skills.</p><p>Later on, when you make your career as an independent freelance writer, you will have difficulty finding connections who recognize you for your writing skills. You will have to start as a freelance writer from scratch.</p><ul><li><h3>Creates a terrible market for other high-quality writers and content</h3></li></ul><p>There are experienced writers who can write amazing pieces of content but are starving. Why?</p><p>Inexperienced clients don\'t realize the low-quality of content churned out by a content farm. They see that 2 cents per word is the going rate and think that\'s what they should pay.</p><p>Who wants to $100 per blog post when they think $30 is the market average?</p><p>When you\'re stuck with content mill writing, you\'re not only hampering your own freelance writing business, you\'re hampering other writers\' businesses.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><h3>Little or no code of ethics</h3></li></ul><p>When you write for a content mill, you may find you take on unethical work.</p><p>For example, can you write an honest review for a baby food product when you don\'t have young kids? How fair is it to the readers?</p><p>You may write a fully SEO optimized 2,500+ word review on a baby food brand without knowing if it\'s good or even safe.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>You can start an online writing freelance career writing for content mills. It can be a good move for writers wanting to gain experience and make quick money or a supplemental income. Just make sure you pick one of the reputable ones under \'The best content mills\' above.</p><p>But, if you\'re looking for more money and want to make a serious career out of freelance writing, forget about writing articles for content mills and focus on building your own portfolio by writing for one or two reputable publications.</p><p>Once you\'ve gained a reputation as a freelance writer who writes quality content, you\'ll earn a lot more, and you\'ll attract satisfying freelance writing projects.</p>', 'When starting out in your freelance writing career, you may hear about content mills.

It\'s difficult without a tried and tested formula at hand. AIDA is a well-known formula that has been used repeatedly with proven success.</p><h2><strong>What is AIDA?</strong></h2><p>AIDA is a century-old copywriting formula widely used by writers to convert visitors into paying customers.</p><p>AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action, the four stages of the customer purchase process. Think of these stages as the different stages of interaction customers have with a product or service before they finally become buyers.</p><h3><strong>The four stages of the AIDA formula are:</strong></h3><ol><li><p>Attention - Create attention by creating awareness about your product or service.</p></li><li><p>Interest - Foster interest in your product or service by connecting with the reader.</p></li><li><p>Desire - Create desire for your product by highlighting the benefits of the product or service.</p></li><li><p>Action - Compel your audience to take buying action.</p></li></ol><p>AIDA is one of the most simple copywriting formulas used by marketers, salespeople, and advertisers, to engage, attract and convert leads into clients.</p><p>The AIDA model can be easily adapted to suit different marketing channels, such as email marketing, sales letter, digital marketing, and social media platforms.</p><h2><strong>The origins of the AIDA formula</strong></h2><p>AIDA has its origins in 1898 when Elias St. Elmo Lewis, a world-famous copywriter who features in the Advertising Hall of Fame, revealed his copywriting secrets in the famous American magazine Inland Printer.</p><p>He stated that one should follow a certain formula to become a successful copywriter and advertiser. That formula came to be known as the AIDA formula. It\'s one of the oldest copywriting formulas, and because it works so well, it\'s still widely used in marketing and advertising.</p><h2><strong>Why is AIDA important as a marketing formula?</strong></h2><h2><strong><br></strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">AIDA is an elegant formula. It forces you to understand the prospect or potential customer and their motivation for buying. When you know the prospect\'s desires, needs and wants, you can successfully encourage them to buy your product or service.</span><br></p><p>It also goes through the natural process we all go through when we want to purchase something. We all become aware of a product or service (attention) but have little interest because we\'re unsure whether it\'s for \'people like me.\'</p><p>We then become interested in the product or service when we see or hear marketing that talks to our desires, needs and wants, which makes us feel that this is something for us (the interest stage).</p><p>We start to want the product or service (desire) when we see or hear anything that highlights the benefits of having it in our lives.</p><p>Finally, we become buyers when we receive a compelling call to action that asks us to buy.</p><p>When you write using the AIDA model, you write copy that hits all stages of the customer purchase process. Missing just one stage completely damages the journey.</p><h2><strong>AIDA copywriting formula best practices</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for success in your marketing efforts using the AIDA formula.</p><h3><strong>1) Write a compelling headline&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>What do you see first when you see an ad? The headline, of course! Creating a great headline hooks your reader into reading through your blog post (the attention stage of AIDA).</p><p>If nobody reads your copy, nobody buys your product. It\'s as simple as that. 80% of readers don\'t move past the headline, so you can\'t get to generate their interest, create desire and then compel them to take action.</p><p>Some strategies to craft a great headline are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Make it urgent</strong></p></li></ul><p>When your headline conveys a sense of urgency, it implies that if the reader does not take action immediately, they will lose out on something special.</p><p>This can improve the click-through rate.</p><p>Example: 5 amazing makeup trends you are not aware of!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quote specific numbers</strong></p></li></ul><p>A specific headline grabs more attention. Imagine a headline that is \'How to lose weight!\' Now, compare that to How to lose 8kg in 30 days!</p><p>Adding \'8kg\' and \'30 days\' is more attention-grabbing as it arouses curiosity. A reader will think, \"Is it possible to lose that weight in just 30 days? How?\"</p><p>It also adds credibility. Facts are specific. Lies are vague.</p><p>Example: How I made $10,000 per month from writing sales copy.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Speak directly to your audience</strong></p></li></ul><p>Know who your audience is and target it precisely. Mention the people you are writing for directly in the headline. Make them think, \"This is for me!\"</p><p>Example: Become a content marketing manager in just 6 months.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bring on the emotion</strong></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;Supercharge your copy with emotion. Remember, the buying process is an emotional one. Get people’s attention by using emotion-filled words and phrases.</p><p>Example: Powerful stress-busting tips you need to know</p><h3><strong>2) Speak directly to your buyer persona</strong></h3><p>Your target audience should feel that you are speaking directly to them throughout the copy, especially in the opening paragraph. You should use ‘you’ and ‘your’ in your marketing language.</p><p>This makes your prospects feel that you are paying special attention to them. For example, if your target buyer persona is a marketing manager, address your title to them personally.</p><h3><strong>3) Use style elements</strong></h3><p>Style elements like underlining, italics, and bold help certain ideas in your marketing copy to stand out. It\'s important to remember that prospects are not just attracted by how a copy reads but also how it looks.</p><p>Styling it with different style elements helps it to stand out and drive the message home. But at the same time, don\'t overwhelm your viewer with over-styling. Use style elements only when it is appropriate. Ideally, you want to use them when mentioning anything that makes a reader think, \"That\'s me!\" (the interest stage of AIDA) or how the product or service will benefit them (the desire stage of AIDA).</p><h2><strong>The AIDA copywriting formula broken down</strong></h2><p>The above best practices are a quickstart guide. If you want to perfect your AIDA understanding to write the absolute best copy, stick around to get step-by-step instructions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attract attention</strong></p></li></ul><p>It is just like wooing a partner. You need to have a great pickup line, or a hook, to reel your prospect in. Remember, you\'re competing with hundreds of similar sites.</p><p>For blogs and articles, the hook is the headline. For emails, they are the subject lines.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you write a headline, you first need to understand the buyer\'s needs. Research your customer\'s background, motivation, demographics, job profiles, etc. Understand why they will be interested in buying the product or service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Direct, actionable language is the best policy.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Use emotional words to create powerful copy.</p></li><li><p>A great idea is to encourage a response by asking questions.</p></li><li><p>Make your copy relevant to your target market.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Don’t:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>Don’t fake your expertise.</p></li><li><p>Avoid capslocks or using too many style settings. Let your content speak for itself.</p></li><li><p>Don’t use spammy words and cliches like ‘free’ or ‘urgent.’</p></li></ol><ul><li><p><strong>Create Interest</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once you have caught your audience\'s attention, the more difficult task is to inspire their interest in your product.</p><p>The longer they stick around, the more they\'re likely to move to the desire stage and then the action stage.</p><p>Another advantage is that the longer a reader sticks around, it signals to Google that your content is interesting and relevant, which means the content ranks higher on Google search results.<span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Personalize your content to connect with readers so they think, \"This is for me.\"</p></li><li><p>Promise a solution to their problem.</p></li><li><p>Show them that you understand their needs and wants.</p></li><li><p>Use industry terms and speak their language.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Don’t overwhelm viewers with a lengthy, complicated copy.</p></li><li><p>Don’t add irrelevant content (this can only happen if you don\'t know your audience).</p></li><li><p>Don’t focus on your own goals and benefits. Focus on the reader\'s goals and benefits.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>Create Desire</strong></h3><p>Once you create interest in your customer for your content, you can generate the desire to buy your service or product. Generating desire is the cornerstone of effective copywriting.</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Tell them your offer (no one likes \'blind\' copy).</p></li><li><p>Pitch the benefits of your offer (not just the features).</p></li><li><p>Show them how you are unique from others.</p></li><li><p>Increase your credibility by highlighting demonstrative examples or testimonials.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Don\'t go overboard with promotion.</p></li><li><p>Don\'t bury your offer by writing too much content.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>Call to Action (CTA)</strong></h3><p>This is the final stage! Your call to action should be clear and concise.</p><p>Tell your potential lead exactly what they need to do. Anything wishy-washy, and you\'ll lose momentum and lose the sale.</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Clearly outline the CTA steps.</p></li><li><p>Reduce \'buyer\'s remorse\' friction by using encouraging language.</p></li><li><p>Make their job of taking action as easy as possible (i.e., don\'t have lots of hoops they need to jump through just to buy).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Don\'t:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Don’t use vague directions (\'click on the button directly below\' will convert far more than \'click\' - what should they click?)</p></li><li><p>Don\'t pile on too many call-to-action options as you risk choice paralysis.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>AIDA writing formula case study - Casper</strong></h2><p>Let\'s go through the AIDA formula step-by-step to see why this is a successful copy.</p><h3><strong>Attention:</strong></h3><p>The headline, \'How to get pee out of a mattress: 6 easy steps\' grabs attention and arouses a ton of curiosity for parents and pet parents.</p><p>Casper knows its target market and, therefore, its pain points, needs, wants, etc. This is a common problem with children.</p><p>And using a specific number with \'6 steps\' arouses further curiosity and credibility.</p><h3><strong>Interest:</strong></h3><p>They swiftly move on to the task of keeping the reader\'s interest by making them feel like this content is just for them.</p><p>They talk about \'hours of scrubbing\' and \'lingering scent\' because they know that\'s what their target audience experiences. Notice how they use emotional words and phrases, such as \'sinking feeling.\' You can only write effective copy like this when you know your audience.</p><h3><strong>Desire:</strong></h3><p>They announce that they will deliver on their promise of six steps to get pee out of a mattress. But just before they do, they also mention that prevention is better than cure - a mattress protector.</p><p>This is a clever way to place a marketing message. They\'ve just given you the solution to prevent this problem from happening again.</p><h3><strong>Action:</strong></h3><p>There is no vague call to action. There\'s no confusion about what a reader should do next to buy a mattress protector.</p><p>There is a clear button inviting them to \'Shop Waterproof Mattress Protector) - what else would you press a button for on this page?</p><h2><strong>AIDA writing formula case study - Coca-Cola</strong></h2><p>Coca-Cola has been around for almost as long as AIDA. And like AIDA, it\'s still going strong!</p><p>Whether advertising Coke Zero, Diet Coke, or any product, the AIDA formula stands.</p><h3><strong>Attention:</strong></h3><p>Whether in print, on TV, in digital ads, etc. Coca-Cola is great at grabbing attention because they understand its audience.</p><p>In this example, they know their audience loves the hissing sound that comes from removing a bottle cap.</p><h3><strong>Interest:</strong></h3><p>In most Coco-Cola content marketing, there are images of people representing the typical Coca-Cola customers.</p><p>This helps potential customers think, \"This is me.\"</p><p>You\'ll also see content customized toward different events and holidays in the year. Again, this fosters a sense of \"this is for me\" when their target audience sees people doing things they are doing during that time of year.</p><h3><strong>Desire</strong></h3><p>Coca-Cola is very clever in positioning its products as the fun-creating solution to any day or event.</p><p>As far back as the 30s, Coca-Cola depicted Santa drinking Coke to help him muster up the energy for a night of delivering toys to children.</p><p>Since then, Coca-Cola has been synonymous with Christmas, and sales of its products go through the roof during this time of year.</p><h3><strong>Action</strong></h3><p>Coca-Cola ensures in all its marketing messages that everyone knows they can get their product from most food stores and use language to entice people to go and buy now.</p><p>One of their most successful call to action was \'Share a Coke.\' See how calls to action like this not only encourage consumers to buy but also evoke feel-good emotions by encouraging you to gift the experience of Coke to a friend or loved one.</p><h2><strong>Why the AIDA method is timeless for digital marketing</strong></h2><p>It\'s timeless because Coca-Cola spends millions using the formula. They\'ve been doing so since its inception. Tech giant Apple also uses the AIDA formula in print and digital ads. Steve Jobs even used it when giving speeches.</p><p>Whether you\'re writing a blog post, paid digital ads, sales page or other marketing materials, the AIDA model works because the journey is the same. You need to grab the reader\'s attention, keep their interest, build desire for what you\'re selling, and then give them the pish to buy.</p>', 'Have you ever tried to bake a delicious cake to impress your guests without a specific recipe?', 'What is the AIDA Copywriting Formula (including examples)?', '', 'AIDA, Copywriting', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, NULL, '2023-01-13 06:20:03', '2023-01-25 08:43:16'),

They can also help your career in journalism and other media fields.</p><p>However, writing feature stories is not as easy as it sounds – you need to find an interesting topic, research it, interview people involved in the story, write up your research and make it interesting for readers.</p><p>In this article, we’ll look at how to do all these steps successfully so you can write your own great feature story!</p><h2><strong>The value of feature stories</strong></h2><p>A feature story is a long, in-depth article usually written by a single reporter. Feature stories are often (but not always) accompanied by pictures and graphics. They\'re typically published in the local newspaper or magazine section.</p><p>The word \"feature\" can be confusing because it means both \"special\" and \"characteristic.\" Features can be about people, places, events or ideas—but whatever they are about should have special significance for your audience.</p><p>For example, a recent local story about an alligator living in Lake Ontario was considered newsworthy because of its novelty value (it\'s never happened before). Still, it doesn\'t focus on anything specific about gators, lakes, or Toronto that would make this topic particularly interesting to the readership. So we wouldn\'t consider running it as a feature story (even though the piece was well-written).</p><h2><strong>Feature ideas</strong></h2><p>Feature story ideas are everywhere. The trick is finding them. Here are some of my favorite ways to find story ideas:</p><h3><strong>Current events</strong></h3><p>One of the best ways to find story ideas is to find a current event that is interesting to people. A feature would be a longer follow-up piece to the breaking story. A follow-up to a breaking story or an exclusive will likely interest a major outlet.</p><h3><strong>Most readers are interested in people</strong></h3><p>People are interesting. Therefore, the best feature story ideas focus on interesting people.</p><p>People are more interesting than places and things. An interesting person trumps events, ideas, facts and data — so think about how you can make your story about them (and not just what they did).</p><h3><strong>Listen to the people around you</strong></h3><p>A great place to start is the people around you. Listen to your friends and family because they are often a good source of inspiration. They will be able to tell you about their own experiences with whatever topic you\'re interested in, and these stories can make for good storytelling material.</p><p>You can also listen to people that aren\'t in your life all that much, e.g., those who work at the grocery store or drive an ice cream truck down your street.</p><p>The more time you spend observing others, the more likely you might find something interesting about their lives or jobs that could spark feature story ideas.</p><p>Finally, it\'s important not only to listen but take note of what you\'re hearing. Write down good ideas as they come up, so there\'s no chance of forgetting them when it comes time for brainstorming sessions later on down the line.</p><h3><strong>Search for topics using keyword tools</strong></h3><p>When you start researching a topic, you\'ll want to use keyword tools to find the most popular keywords for that topic.</p><p>A keyword tool will give you a quick overview of what people are searching for about your topic and how many searches there are for each term. These are valuable metrics because they show what consumers are interested in at any given time.</p><p>For example, if you search \"how much money do artists make?\" on Google Trends, it gives a graph showing that this question has been asked frequently over the last year (and even longer).</p><p>The graph also shows how often people searched for each variation of this question, like \"how much money do writers make?\" or \"what\'s an artist\'s salary.\" This is helpful information when deciding which idea is best suited for your audience.</p><h3><strong>Attend cultural events in your community</strong></h3><p>Attending cultural events in your community is a great way to find story ideas. You can meet new people, learn about different cultures and experience new things.</p><h2><strong>Researching your idea</strong></h2><p>To write a good feature story, you need to start with research. Here are some things you should do:</p><ul><li><p>Google it. If there are companies or people that specialize in what it is you want to write about, Google those keywords and see if they come up on the first page of results. Also, look for other places that might be able to help—local newspapers and magazines, industry publications, etc., as well as any blogs or podcasts related to your topic (or even unrelated).</p></li><li><p>Use your own experience. If there\'s something in your work background that relates—whether it\'s having worked at a certain company or being familiar with certain technical terms—use them. Readers love seeing someone who knows what they\'re talking about taking them on an insightful journey through their field of expertise so long as they don’t come across as pretentious or arrogant.</p></li><li><p>Talk to people who have experience in this area, too, both professionals working in the industry and non-professionals who may just be enthusiasts. This way, there\'ll be more voices contributing great ideas, which makes your feature story stronger than just relying upon one person alone.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Interviewing</strong></h2><p>Interviewing is a great way to get your story ideas and fill in the details. You can interview people who have experienced or studied whatever it is you\'re writing about, whether it\'s an expert in the field or just someone who has been through something similar.</p><p>If you\'re writing a story about becoming a professional ice skater, for example, interviewing other athletes might give you insight into what their training regimen was like and what challenges they had to overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to write about how technology affects our relationships with friends and family members, interviewing people who love Facebook Messenger might give them enough material for an entire article.</p><p>When interviewing people, focus on getting information rather than making them feel uncomfortable or stressed out—that way, they\'ll be more likely to open up with deep thoughts and feelings instead of just giving short answers.</p><p>Ask open-ended questions like: \"What made this experience difficult?\" or \"How did this affect your life?\" These questions will help guide them toward talking about their experiences without coming off as manipulative (which could lead them away from being willing to share).</p><p>When recording an interview on the phone (or via video chat), use good equipment so that everything sounds clear when transcribed later on.&nbsp;</p><p>Hold conversations in quiet rooms if possible. Find headphones that don\'t make noises when clicking around buttons.&nbsp;</p><p>Record at least two different perspectives even if one person may have said something better than another person would\'ve been able to say themselves.</p><h2><strong>Creating a structure for your story</strong></h2><p>The story structure is the foundation of your story. You can\'t build a house without a solid foundation, and you can\'t write an article without one, either.</p><p>Before you start writing, take some time to plan out your story\'s structure by answering these questions:</p><ul><li><p>What are the main points I\'m trying to make?</p></li><li><p>What order should I put them in?</p></li><li><p>How much information do I need before I can begin making those points?</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Writing and revising your feature story</strong></h2><p>After you finish writing the feature story, the next step is to revise it. If possible, you should use a spell checker and grammar checker before submitting your article to an editor.</p><ul><li><p>Make sure that the piece is clear and concise by revising it repeatedly until every sentence makes sense on its own without needing any context from another sentence or paragraph (or from other articles).</p></li><li><p>Check that all of your facts are accurate. Make sure that your spelling, grammar, and punctuation are all correct. If anything is wrong with them, fix those errors before submitting a piece for publication.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Finding your audience (getting hired)</strong></h2><p>For your feature story to be picked up by a newspaper or magazine, you need to know its audience. You should be able to answer these questions:</p><ul><li><p>Who is this story for?</p></li><li><p>What do they want to read?</p></li><li><p>What are they interested in?</p></li><li><p>Why should they care about what I have to say? And how can I make them care more?</p></li></ul><p>Once you know the answers to those questions, it’s time for research. Go out and find some stories that have already been written on the subject (there are plenty of resources available online).</p><p>Read through them carefully and see what makes them interesting or unique. Think about what could make yours stand out from all others—what angle could make it more engaging for your target audience? Then use that as a starting point when writing out your own proposal.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As a features writer, your main goal is to find an interesting topic to write about, do the research and develop a story that other people also find interesting.</p><p>You\'ll need to research to find out what the audience of a particular newspaper or magazine is interested in. You can then take this \'intel\' and create an interesting feature story that an editor would love to publish - good luck!<br>', 'Feature stories are a great way to get your name and work out there.

It\'s how we speak to our friends and family members, express ourselves on social media and write emails at work.</p><p>In short, our voice is who we are. But what exactly is voice? And how can you use your own authentic tone when writing?</p><h2><strong>The definition of tone,</strong></h2><p>The dictionary meaning of tone is \"the attitude that a writer or speaker conveys.\"</p><p>When you read an article about how to set up a home office, for example, you might feel that it\'s written in a friendly tone if the author seems happy and enthusiastic about setting up your new workspace.</p><p>Suppose you visit your local coffee shop and order one of their specialty drinks, say an iced caramel latte with two pumps of vanilla syrup and whipped cream drizzled on top. In that case, you\'d probably expect something different from the barista than if they were handing over change at the register after buying some gum at the gas station across town.</p><p>In both cases, the friendly home office post and the welcoming coffee shop interaction, you know what kind of person wrote/said these things just by reading them because they represent different attitudes.</p><p>One is helpful, while another can be snarky. One wants success, while the other wishes they could take off their shoes and get comfortable before being served dessert.</p><h2><strong>What Is Tone in Writing?</strong></h2><p>Tone is the attitude or feeling you convey in your writing. It’s the way you sound when you write.</p><p>For example, if I were to say, “I saw a movie last night,” my tone would be casual and conversational. In contrast, if I wrote something like, “Last night I saw a movie that was very entertaining!” my tone would be more formal and enthusiastic.</p><p>Tone is an important part of good business writing because it helps establish a connection with readers by understanding how they should feel about what they are reading.</p><h2><strong>Writing Tone vs. Writing Voice</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, there is confusion between tone and voice, and newbie writers may use both terms interchangeably.</p><p>Tone is different from voice. Voice refers to the writing style itself; who you are as a person comes through in your choice of words, sentence structure and diction (vocabulary).</p><p>Voice is also influenced by your experiences growing up, such as where you grew up, what language was spoken around you at home (if any), and what books were read aloud during childhood.</p><p>But it doesn\'t depend on those factors alone. You can choose how educated or uneducated you want to sound. A word choice like “antiquated” might make sense for an academic paper on Shakespeare but would seem out of place in an email promoting a sale at a clothing store.</p><p>Your voice and, therefore, your writing style will change depending on the content or message you share.&nbsp;</p><p>However, your tone should remain consistent throughout all pieces of content that share the same purpose (for example, if all blog posts are meant to be helpful).</p><h2><strong>How to Choose the Right Tone</strong></h2><p>To choose the right tone, you need to know who you\'re writing for and what message you want to convey:</p><ul><li><p>Are your readers familiar with the brand you’re writing for? If not, do they know about it at all?</p></li><li><p>What is the purpose of this piece? Is it informative or persuasive?</p></li><li><p>Are the readers likely to share it with others after reading it, or are they more likely just read for themselves (as in a blog post)?</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Think About Your Audience</strong></h2><p>The starting point for any piece of creative writing is knowing your audience. Your tone should reflect the expectations and needs of your audience, as well as their interests and values.</p><p>To get started, you need to consider the following:</p><ul><li><p>Demographics: Gender, age range, location (city/country), education level etc.</p></li><li><p>Language: Are they native English speakers or non-native? How is their grammar? What about spelling?</p></li><li><p>Culture: Do they prefer direct communication versus indirect? Are politics viewed as a conversational taboo, or are they passionate about current events?</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Tailor Tone for Specific Content</strong></h2><p>You should tailor the tone to the content and audience. The tone can be formal or casual, highbrow or lowbrow, bold or quiet.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s why you might hear an NPR host say something like “Hey guys!” and then turn around and hear another say, “This is NPR News.” The first example is more informal, while the second is more formal.</p><p>Regarding what your audience prefers, that depends on who they are (business people might like more professionalism than teenagers).</p><p>And remember, it’s not just what they want from us. It’s also about how much information we want them to digest concerning our goals for the writing we create together.</p><h2><strong>How do I know when I\'ve got the wrong tone?</strong></h2><p>There\'s no right or wrong when it comes to tone, as the tone of your writing will depend on the piece\'s content.&nbsp;</p><p>If you\'re unsure about the tone of your work, try testing out different sentences or paragraphs on friends and family first and ask them to be honest with you. They’ll let you know if the tone seems slightly “off.”</p><p>A great way to avoid hitting the wrong tone is to find an emotion that matches the tone of your work. For example, try conveying happiness in your word choice if you\'re writing about a happy event.</p><h2><strong>What should I avoid when trying to find the correct tone?</strong></h2><p>Your audience will connect with you more if they feel like you\'re actually talking to them. That means avoiding words and phrases that might make you look arrogant or cocky - this will only make you look bad.</p><p>Instead, try to use words and phrases that convey the emotions you feel while writing. For example, if you are writing about someone struggling, try to show their feelings through your writing instead of putting them into perfect words.</p><p>Lastly, avoid sounding preachy, condescending, or pedantic - these tones will put people off instead of drawing them in.</p><h2><strong>Don\'t get too caught up in trying to find the \"right\" voice or tone</strong></h2><p>Although finding the right tone is important, don\'t get too caught up in it. It\'s more important to focus on what you want to say and how you want your audience will respond.</p><p>Just be yourself.&nbsp; Write with your own voice, use your own words, and be authentic and honest in what you say.</p><p>In other words, just write how you would normally talk if someone asked you a question about the topic at hand.</p><p>And then listen intently for feedback from the audience. That’s how you truly learn whether your tone was spot on or off the mark.</p><h2><strong>Use a Consistent Style Guide</strong></h2><p>Although not strictly a part of writing tone, a sloppy style can certainly affect tone.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s important to be consistent in how you use punctuation, capitalization, and other elements of grammar.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, don\'t capitalize a word unless it\'s a proper noun (like \"New York City\") or if it is at the beginning of a sentence.</p><p>You should also avoid using different style guides throughout your work. Instead, choose one and stick with it throughout your writing so that readers can easily follow along from start to finish.</p><p>Many style guides are available for free online, and some even include samples for inspiration.</p><h2><strong>The copy is a reflection of the brand</strong></h2><p>The tone of your copy should be consistent with what you want your company to look like, sound like, and feel like. Your tone needs to match how people perceive your brand.</p><p>It’s also important that all communications align with one another in tone.</p><p>If you have an upbeat and fun personality as a business but then write in an overly formal tone in some places, it would confuse people who aren’t familiar with your business or industry.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The tone in creative writing can be tricky to nail down, but by understanding the different aspects of tone, you\'ll find the correct tone for your writing.</p><p>The tone of your writing will reflect the brand\'s personality, so it\'s important to choose the right one. The best way to find the correct tone is by practicing and getting feedback from your audience.</p><p>Also, remember that all writing has a tone, so don\'t get too caught up in trying to find the \"right\" voice or tone - there isn\'t one.</p><p>By understanding tone and how to choose the right one for your content, you\'ll be well on your way to writing with authority and style.</p><p>Keep the blog posts coming, and let us know how you go!</p>', 'We all have a tone of voice, whether we realize it or not.

So it\'s understandable if you think you might miss out on ideal clients for your copywriting business by not posting regularly on Instagram.</p><p>The truth is, you are!</p><p>However, that does not mean you stop whatever you\'re doing and start making a ton of Instagram stories.</p><p>Strategy is everything. Blindly posting on your Instagram account will just take up all your time and energy, with no new freelance clients to show for your efforts.</p><p>We\'ve put together the ultimate Instagram strategy guaranteed to find clients for your freelance copywriting business.</p><h2><strong>Your Instagram social media marketing strategy</strong></h2><p>Here is your step-by-step Instagram marketing strategy designed to turn your Instagram account into a magnet for prospective clients.</p><h3><strong>\'Brand\' your Instagram account</strong></h3><p>Instagram does not allow you to change background colors or add customizations. However, you can use your posts to give a \'feel\' of who you are and what you do.</p><p>Remember, Instagram is a visual social media service. When someone arrives on your profile, they will see a grid of your most recent posts. This differs from the \'feed\' style of recent posts you see on Facebook or LinkedIn.</p><p>Professional Instagram marketers use this to their advantage by setting a \'brand voice\' early on. This means all posts have the same colors, fonts, etc., so there is a harmonious and professional feel when someone lands on the Instagram profile.</p><p>Start to see your Instagram profile page as the homepage of a website. Would you think it was professional if you stumbled across a website with no discernable branding and all kinds of colors and fonts?</p><h3><strong>Create Instagram content that meets your audience\'s needs</strong></h3><p>You\'d think this would be a given for copywriters, as we spend a lot of time determining audience needs when writing content for our clients.</p><p>And yet, we often miss this when it comes to our own marketing.</p><p>If your ideal client is a small business, creating content about copywriting tips or your copywriting services won\'t work. Most small business owners aren\'t aware of how a copywriter can solve their problems, such as low sales, stiff competition, etc.</p><p>Instead, focus your content on business growth. All business owners want to grow, no matter how big or small. Educate them on how good copywriting can grow their business.</p><h3><strong>Create regular content to find clients</strong></h3><p>While each social networking service has differing algorithms, they all agree on one aspect. The more you post, the more the platform will show your posts to others. The Instagram algorithm is no different.</p><p>Writing a few posts for a week and then dropping off the radar is a waste of your time and effort.</p><p>If you want to generate leads from Instagram, you need to dedicate some time to posting regularly, ideally once per day.</p><p>The good news is as Instagram is a visual social media platform, you don\'t have to write much. It\'s all about creating eye-catching visuals.</p><p>Have fun with content creation!</p><p>Do you love funny memes and jokes? Do you have some favorite motivating quotes? Your Instagram account is where you can share them as it shows off your personality.</p><p>Also, don\'t be afraid to \'re-use\' content elsewhere (make sure you attribute it, so you\'re not accused of repurposing other people\'s content as your own). This is called content curation, and it\'s a great way to save time on creating your own content while still showing off who you are.</p><p>Just remember to use your brand voice throughout all your posts.</p><h3><strong>Use hashtags intelligently</strong></h3><p>If you\'ve written SEO content for clients as a copywriter, you\'ll know that trying to rank for the highest searched keywords on Google is not a great strategy. There\'s usually far too much competition.</p><p>A more intelligent approach is to use high-intent longtail keywords with lower search volumes.</p><p>And yet, many writers forget about this when it comes to Instagram.</p><p>Using ultra-popular hashtags with millions of mentions will mean your posts get lost in a sea of noise.</p><p>Instead, focus on hashtags with a few thousand to under 400k mentions. They\'re still popular, but not so crazy popular that you get lost.</p><h3><strong>Use hashtags that represent you</strong></h3><p>This is similar to brand voice. There\'s more to you than \'just\' copywriting.</p><p>Perhaps you focus on clients who have sustainable or green goals? Maybe you\'re proud of owning a woman-owned business.</p><p>Find hashtags that represent these aspects of your business. Yes, you need to use hashtags focused on what you do, but it pays to add hashtags that go beyond this and show prospective clients who you are.</p><p>The key to long term clients is people resonating with who you are and not just your great copywriting skills.</p><h3><strong>Social media marketing is a two-way street</strong></h3><p>As copywriters, we\'re guilty of seeing social media marketing as a one-way avenue. We create content for our clients, who broadcast it to their audience.</p><p>However, social media marketing works in both directions. Savvy copywriters know this as well as savvy business owners.</p><p>Spend time looking at other people\'s Instagram posts, particularly those who could be future copywriting clients.</p><p>Like their posts and, even better, write meaningful comments. It\'s easy to hit the like button, but a comment takes time, and your prospective clients will notice the effort.</p><p>Most people\'s guards are down on social media, especially somewhere like Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas cold emailing or cold calling puts people in a defensive mode, a comment on an Instagram post by a stranger rarely causes negativity, especially if the comment is positive and meaningful.</p><h3><strong>Think in terms of friends first and freelance clients second</strong></h3><p>Once you\'ve got a potential client\'s attention, sending them a direct message is acceptable. Remember, this is not like cold emails or cold calling.</p><p>However, don\'t abuse this. As their guard will be down, you don\'t want to go directly into \"sell, sell, sell!\" Doing this will be even worse than getting the brush off when cold calling - at least they were expecting the pitch.</p><p>Instead, think in terms of being a friend, not a salesperson.</p><p>Get to know your prospective client. How are they doing? Who are they? What\'s important to them? Let your conversation flow naturally.</p><p>Trust us. If they enjoy the conversion, you can bet they\'ve checked out your Instagram profile.</p><p>If you follow the first and second steps in this Instagram social media marketing strategy, your brand voice and posts will tell them everything they need to know about what you do and how they can benefit.</p><h3><strong>Show off your writing prowess</strong></h3><p>Yes, Instagram is a visual social media platform, so do not write long blog posts or huge press release-style posts.</p><p>However, you\'re a copywriter. You can bet your potential clients will judge your words on your Instagram posts. After all, if you knew someone was a photographer, you\'d check out the quality of their photos, correct?</p><p>Think of your Instagram posts as a mini portfolio of your work. Yes, you can’t show off long-form writing style, but you can certainly show off short-form and medium-form.</p><p>Use your posts to show how intelligently you can write captions and how engaging you can make your posts. Your potential clients will notice and want the same for their marketing.</p><h2><strong>Finding copywriting clients on Instagram</strong></h2><p>There\'s no quick fix when it comes to finding clients on Instagram. However, there\'s no quick fix for finding copywriting clients anywhere!</p><p>The key is to pick one or two lead-generating strategies and spend time nurturing them. This will yield far better results than trying all kinds of strategies and spreading yourself thin.</p><p>If you\'ve chosen Instagram as one of your main lead-generating strategies, following the above steps over a few months is guaranteed to get you clients.</p><p>Please do let us know your Instagram client-generating success stories!</p>', 'Depending on who you listen to, your Instagram account is either the holy grail for client generation or a complete time suck.', 'How to Find Copywriting Clients on Instagram', '', 'Copywriter, copywriting, Instagram', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, NULL, '2023-01-13 06:44:20', '2023-01-25 08:38:04');

AI copywriting tools to check out <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://Copy.ai\"><u>Copy.ai</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://Jasper.ai\"><u>Jasper.ai</u></a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">2. From copywriter to copywriting consultant</span></p><p>This trend is a follow-on from the AI copywriting trend. As artificial intelligence becomes smarter and creates a realistic copy, human copywriters will be seen in a more consultative role.</p><p>Instead of ‘doing’ the copywriting, you will become someone who gives advice and creates frameworks.</p><p>Use knowledge of this trend to your advantage by helping your customers. Ask them what difficulties they have and how copy can solve those problems. How can you help them with their overall content marketing strategy?</p><p>Start demonstrating that ‘consultant’ side of you now to stay ahead.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The ‘doing’ copywriters will fall by the wayside as AI becomes even more intelligent, but you’ll have nothing to worry about as a copywriting consultant.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">3. Interactive content</span></p><p>Chatbots have become the norm as interactive content in the last few years, and in 2023, they’re set to become even more popular with advancements such as natural language processing and machine learning.</p><p>Then there\'s augmented reality which sounded so futuristic just two to three years ago but is already becoming normal for forward-thinking businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you fit into this as a copywriter? It’s simple. Interactive content still requires intelligent, well-thought-out content.&nbsp;In fact, tailoring content can require <em>more </em>content.</p><p>For example, we’re sure you’ve had a bad chatbot experience. Yes, some of that experience may be to do with software issues, but a lot of it has to do with bad or no copywriting. ‘Canned’ responses that don’t help a customer or lead them to a dead end are not only a lost opportunity but can also lead to complaints.</p><p>Make sure you demonstrate the need for great copy, no matter how futuristic-sounding the technology is. Great content is great content and will always be necessary, no matter the form it comes in.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">4. Copywriting for video</span></p><p>Video is the most consumed content online and has been for several years., It will be no different in 2023 as it continues to dominate copywriting trends.</p><p>Offer video copywriting in the form of scripts and video strategy will become a key tool in your arsenal to attract and keep customers going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Scriptwriting for videos will also change depending on the platform. For example, TikTok is known for short-form videos, while YouTube is the king of longer videos.</p><p></p><p>Demonstrating your knowledge of best practices and what converts best on different platforms will earmark you as the copywriter to hire.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p>If you already have skills in this department, let your current clients know by demonstrating your knowledge of whatever platform they use to generate leads.</p><p>If you don’t have video copywriting skills, now is the time to upskill.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">5. Consistent brand tone on all channels</span></p><p>Another trend gathering pace for a few years is the need for a brand to sound uniform across all channels and platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>This is great news for you as you can use this knowledge to negotiate bigger projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Educate them on why having different writers for blog posts, LinkedIn, web copy, adverts, etc., hurts their conversions and sales.</p><p>It makes far more sense for one copywriter to handle all the content (or, if that’s too much, be the copywriting consultant that manages and delegates to others) to ensure a consistent brand tone.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">6. Webinars</span></p><p>Webinars continue to be a key content marketing trend that shows no sign of stopping in 2023, and it’s understandable why.</p><p>Webinars are a great place for businesses to showcase their products and allow their customer to engage with the brand fully.</p><p>However, many brands don’t use webinars because of the time and effort spent on content creation, such as scripts, presentation slides, handouts, promo copy, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Demonstrate your knowledge in this area to current and prospective customers (and if you don’t know, learn it!) They’re likely leaving money on the table by not utilizing webinars in their content marketing, and your copywriting could be the key to unlocking these profits.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">7. Using FAQs</span></p><p>Did you know that 14% of all searches on Google searches start with the word ‘how?’</p><p>This means millions of people every day look for answers to their questions.&nbsp;</p><p>We all know that the aim of all content marketing is to answer those questions. But online attention spans continue to drop, so the average person makes snap judgments about whether your content will give them the answer they’re looking for.</p><p>This is what FAQs are one of the biggest copywriting trends. If someone spots a question that is identical (or almost identical) to the one they’ve searched on Google, they’re more likely to click on your content than a competitor’s.</p><p>Sadly, a lot of businesses either don’t have an FAQ section or see it as somewhere to dump a few general questions.</p><p>Intelligent business owners keep tabs on what their ideal customers are typing into Google and other search engines and use this to create FAQs that customers actually ask.</p><p>And now that you have this vital information, you can also wow your customers by creating FAQs that get them noticed by their potential customers.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 0.875rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">8. Case study-based storytelling</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">We don’t need to tell you that storytelling is one of the most important things you’ll learn to create high-quality content.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>This trend is all about marrying storytelling with data. Stories are the key to grabbing and keeping the attention from a target audience. However, it’s hard facts we want to see when making a buying decision.</p><p>Using both is the key to gaining attention that converts into sales.&nbsp;</p><p>Create stories based on case studies. Start with the problem a particular customer had and how they tried to find a solution without success.&nbsp;</p><p>Now enters the product or service in your story. Demonstrate with hard facts and figures how the problem was solved. How did the product or service save or make money, and how much? Or how much time did the product or service save, etc.?&nbsp;</p><p>If your current clients are not using case study-based storytelling, now is the time to tell them they’re missing out!</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">9. Repurposing as a content marketing strategy</span><br></p><p>Repurposing content is not new, but 2023 will be the year more businesses realize how much content they already have, and it’s a more efficient content strategy to repurpose than keep generating new content all the time.</p><p>The problem? Repurposing does not mean just taking content wholesale from one platform and dumping it into another.</p><p>For example, you wouldn’t take a 2,000-word article and send that as an email.</p><p>The problem for businesses is that repurposing takes time and effort. That’s where you come in.</p><p>Demonstrate your understanding of different platforms and best practices for repurposing.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you could tell a client that a 2,000-word article is best summarized into two to three ‘teaser’ paragraphs for an email and then a link to the original article.&nbsp;</p><p>Or you can rewrite the article into ‘episodes’ to go out via email sequentially.</p><p>The benefit for you is that you are creating work for yourself, and the work is relatively easy as there’s no research or content creation from scratch involved - just rewriting.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">10. Voice search</span></p><p>More and more people have smart speakers, which will change the content.</p><p>As we go into 2023, how your copy looks will be less important. Instead, how you use words and how they <em>sound </em>in voice search will become more important.&nbsp;</p><p>There will likely be a move away from keyword-focused titles and headings. Instead, it would make sense for titles and headings to be framed as sentences that a user would use to ask for something in voice searches.</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">11. Copy that works when English is a foreign language</span></p><p>As we become a global neighborhood, the need for copy that is understood and resonates has become a key content marketing trend.</p><p>Even within English-speaking countries, there can be huge differences in the context of certain words and phrases.</p><p>As more and more companies cater to global audiences, as a copywriter, you need to ensure you write copy that works whether someone speaks British English, US English, or even English as a foreign language.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">12. Long-form copy</span></p><p>This may be surprising, given the trend for video content. But there appears to be an opposite reaction happening here.</p><p>As people prefer watching videos, when they do want to read, they prefer well-researched, intelligently-written long-form content.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, for social media marketing, the content is getting shorter, but outside of the social media world, it\'s getting longer.<span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">13. Podcasts will become even more popular</span></p><p>More and more businesses realize how podcasts can generate highly qualified leads from their target audience.&nbsp;</p><p>When people listen to podcasts, they usually give them their undivided attention. Compare that to social media platforms, where we’re constantly distracted.</p><p>It’s why leads that come from podcasts are of a higher quality.&nbsp;</p><p>So how does this affect you as a copywriter?&nbsp;</p><p>Many brands and businesses would love to start a podcast but are scared of the time and effort it will take to create content ideas and scripts.</p><p>That’s where you come in! You can help write scripts and episode plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Not many copywriters have these skills, so make sure you learn to stay ahead of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">14. Email marketing remains king of the digital marketing trends</span></p><p>Every year, someone will herald the death of emails. And each year, the evidence points to email marketing as the digital marketing trend that generates the highest ROI.</p><p>This trend will continue in 2023. If you’re a skilled email copywriter, push those skills to the forefront when speaking to potential customers and encourage them to increase their email marketing efforts.</p><p>And if email copywriting is something you’ve never done before, consider upskilling yourself - it will be worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">15. Doubling up content as a content marketing strategy</span></p><p>Many businesses miss opportunities to add other content formats to already existing content.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous content could be made more attractive, understandable, and even more search-friendly by adding, for example, infographics, custom graphics, or videos.&nbsp;</p><p>The more content formats you use, the more chances you have to grab attention.</p><p>As with content repurposing, this doubling-up content strategy is a great way to create new projects for your customers that are relatively easy to do as you’re using existing content.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: bold;\">16. Updating old content as a content marketing strategy</span></p><p>Like repurposing content and doubling up content, most business owners forget content they\'ve previously posted.</p><p>Regarding Google, the age of a website is very important. The older a website, the more credibility and authority it has.</p><p>However, it also needs to see that the website is being updated regularly.</p><p>Most business owners assume this means pumping out new content regularly. While they need to do this, they’re missing an easier content strategy option right under their noses - updating their old content.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at expert content marketers such as Hubspot, for example. Many of their articles will have a note saying the original article is from several years ago, but it’s been updated for this year.&nbsp;</p><p>They do this because they know Google and other search engines will notice the update and boost their articles to higher search results.&nbsp;</p><p>Use this knowledge when speaking to your customers. As them about previous blog posts, articles, and other content. Tell them you can easily update them with new, relevant information.&nbsp;</p><p>You could find you’ve created a huge, lucrative project if they have an extensive library of previous content!</p><h2>Use these content marketing trends to make 2023 your best year</h2><p>As we said before, forewarned is forearmed.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Use the above copywriting trends and content marketing trends to inform how you speak to current and potential clients and coordinate their marketing strategies.</p><p>They will also inform you of any skills gaps you have that you need to plug.</p><p></p><p>Get in touch with us, and let us know how you get on!</p>', 'Being ahead of the game when it comes to copywriting will give you an edge over the competition.', '', '', 'Copywriter.

But there\'s no reason for it to be.</p><p>The reason writing can feel like a chore is that you don\'t have a step-by-step process. When there is no logical order to your own writing, it can feel like waiting for inspiration to strike - disconcerting when you have deadlines to meet.</p><p>However, what trips many people up is they have no structure or process. They subconsciously attempt two or more steps of the writing process simultaneously - a recipe for disaster.</p><p>In this guide, I\'ll walk you through the eight stages of the writing process and how to separate them from each other for optimal results. This is guaranteed to make your writing more effective and enjoyable!</p><h2><strong>Step 1: Start with brainstorming</strong></h2><p>The first step in the writing process is brainstorming. Start writing down any ideas that come to you. It\'s very important not to edit or censor your thoughts.</p><p>You may have heard the phrase, \"The only stupid question is the question that is never asked.\" This attitude is used in brainstorming sessions in forward-thinking businesses because self-censoring or self-editing could mean great questions or ideas are left unsaid.</p><p>Fostering an environment where nothing is wrong and everyone feels encouraged to say whatever is on their mind means these businesses get the best ideas for products, services, improvements, etc.</p><p>You need to adopt the same approach. There is no stupid idea, thought, or question at this stage of the writing process. Make a note of whatever comes to mind.</p><p>If you find your mind is quicker than you can type or write (it often is) and you\'re worried you\'ll lose some thoughts before jotting down, use voice-activated note-taking apps or transcription apps, such as <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://Otter.ai\">Otter.ai</a>.</p><h2><strong>Step 2: Organize the topics your brainstormed (pre-writing)</strong></h2><p>The next step in the writing process is about organizing your ideas into a logical order. The human brain does not think linearly. It tends to \'spark\' in different directions. It\'s why mind mapping was invented, as it mimics how a human brain thinks.</p><p>However, when it comes to writing, no matter how short or long a piece is, you need to organize it sequentially so it\'s easy for readers to follow.</p><p>Go through your list of brainstormed topics and work out the order they would naturally come in your piece.</p><h2><strong>Step 3: Research your topics</strong></h2><p>This step in the writing process is about gathering information from various sources. This information-gathering stage is sometimes called pre-writing, and it helps you narrow down the list of topics you brainstormed before moving forward with drafting your writing.</p><p>To be successful at this stage, consider these questions: What exactly do I want my readers to know? Who are my intended audience members? How can I best communicate my ideas in my writing so they\'re understandable and helpful?</p><p>If there\'s a specific question at hand (e.g., \"Why do people use social media?\"), it may also be helpful to find out where other writers have looked into similar topics so they can give their take on them (e.g., \"What does Sally say about Facebook?\").</p><p>This type of research is called secondary research because it involves looking into other people’s work instead of primary sources such as original documents or interviews with experts who have knowledge about what we’re studying.</p><p>It\'s also important not to forget the breadth of sources available. Some helpful examples are:</p><ul><li><p>academic journals (which contain peer-reviewed articles written by experts)</p></li><li><p>websites maintained by organizations dedicated specifically to scientific inquiry (like NASA)</p></li><li><p>newspaper articles written by journalists working at respected news outlets like The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.</p></li></ul><p>The point is there\'s no shortage of information at your fingertips. The opposite is true. With super fast internet, we have a world of information, almost too much information.</p><p>The trick is to allot a certain amount of time to research. Otherwise, you risk \'going down the rabbit hole,\' losing hours (very easily done) without you accomplishing much writing.</p><p>Spend a few minutes researching each topic you brainstormed to see if it\'s worthwhile to include, and if so, gather information about that topic.</p><h2><strong>Step 4: Plan your structure and outline</strong></h2><p>Not that you\'ve removed irrelevant topics and fleshed out the remaining topics, the next step in the writing process is to create an outline of your content.</p><p>An outline lets readers follow along with what you\'re saying while they read, which makes your writing easier to read and more enjoyable for them (and keeps them from getting lost).</p><p>It also gives you a clear idea of what topics need more explanation or support so that later on, you know where improvements are needed when it\'s time for revision.</p><p>A great structure for any length of writing to follow is:</p><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Introduce your \'why\' of your piece. Why are you here? What are you going to talk about? For example, \"As Gen Z spends up to 6 hours a day on TikTok, is this video-sharing site a creative outlet or damaging mental health?</p><p>It\'s all about \'setting out your stall\' - grabbing your readers\' attention by telling them exactly what you\'ll be discussing and why (and perhaps even the benefits for them)- important if you\'re writing something that may induce a sale).</p><h3><strong>Arguements/sup-topics</strong></h3><p>You\'ve already organized your topics previously. This is where you list these topics into discrete categories.</p><p>For example, in our Tiktok piece, the first category could be TikTok usage statistics, TikTok history, TikTok revenue, etc.</p><p>The second category could be stories and quotes from people who use TikTok and love it for allowing a creative outlet, finding new friends and a sense of community, learning new ideas, positive statistics, etc.</p><p>The third category could be mental health statistics regarding social media and young people, stories and quotes from people adversely affected by TikTok, etc. And so on.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>There\'s nothing worse than a piece of writing that ends abruptly (think about how you feel when a film ends like this).</p><p>Summarise the main points of your writing.</p><p>Depending on the topic and who you\'re writing for, you may write the conclusion with a neutral tone so the reader can make up their mind.</p><p>Or you could write a conclusion that leaves no doubt about which side you\'re on. Follow your client or publisher\'s guideline. Sometimes strong opinions are welcome. Other times, neutrality is key.</p><p>Keep in mind that even though an outline seems set in stone at this point, it will probably change throughout the writing process as new ideas occur or as one topic becomes irrelevant after another develops further during drafting or revision (which we\'ll cover later).</p><p>This can be frustrating if it means going back and changing everything again—but don\'t worry! If necessary, we\'ll show how easy it is once everything you’ve written everything out. Just keep going until then.</p><p>Use numbers/bullets instead of long sentences when describing each paragraph. This makes it easier for readers to scan quickly since they don\'t need all those details immediately but want some sense of what topics you’re discussing within each section before diving deeper into reading specific paragraphs themselves.</p><p>This can also help with keeping track of what you\'ve said in the outline if you need to look back on it later (which we highly recommend doing). Finally, using numbers/bullets instead of long sentences will keep your paragraphs shorter and easier for readers to understand.</p><h2><strong>Step 5: Write the first draft first (don\'t stop to edit)</strong></h2><p>The next step in the writing process is to begin writing your first draft. This means you don’t stop for editing or proofreading during this process. Instead, you should write as quickly as possible without stopping for a set period (sometimes called free writing)</p><p>The good news is that because you\'ve followed the above steps, you won\'t experience what many amateur writers experience, which is racing to get down their ideas and thoughts before they slip away!&nbsp;</p><p>Because you’ve brainstormed, organized, researched and outlined, you\'re at a stage where ideas won\'t escape you.</p><p>However, you still want to write the first draft quickly. If it helps, consider it a ‘rough draft,’ not the final version you will submit.</p><p>You don\'t want to edit because it slows down the writing process. Avoiding editing will help keep your mind focused on what matters most - developing an argument and conveying it effectively through language use (i.e., word choice). Editing is a step further down the line. Keep the different stages separate.</p><p>At this drafting stage, focus on getting your main idea across clearly rather than worrying about spelling or grammatical errors or ensuring every detail is correct.</p><p>It\'s also important not to worry about the quality of your writing when beginning the first draft. This will only slow progress toward completing the assignment in time for submission requirements.</p><p>Focus instead on developing one strong idea per paragraph that relates directly back to your overall topic sentence (which should come right after introductions).</p><h2><strong>Step 6: Take a break, redraft and revise</strong></h2><p>Congratulations! You\'ve written your first draft. The next step in the writing process? Set your document aside and let your brain rest for a bit. You\'ll be re-reading it with fresh eyes later, so don\'t worry if you can\'t think of anything else to add at this point.</p><p>You\'ll also want to reread your first draft with an eye toward larger issues, such as structure and argument (does your writing make sense?) or style (is any of your writing unclear?). Once you\'ve done that, check in with yourself.</p><p>Does it feel like a strong and cohesive piece? Is there any additional evidence that you could add for support? If so, write those down before adding them to your writing later in this process.</p><p>Now, go through each paragraph individually and make revisions based on what needs improvement from an organizational standpoint, stylistic clarity and other problems identified during the editing tasks above.</p><p>You might also want to start thinking about what else you could add to your writing, such as figures, tables and other visual aids.</p><p>While these can certainly be useful for some readers, they aren\'t necessary for all audiences—especially if the point you are trying to make doesn\'t rely on any data presented visually or otherwise.</p><p>So only use them if they add something to your writing or make your writing clearer and more readily understood.</p><p>If you\'re unsure whether your writing needs figures and tables, try reading it aloud. If it sounds choppy or confusing (or if you have to pause during the reading), then you may need to add some visual aids.</p><h2><strong>Step 7: Edit for sentence structure and clarity</strong></h2><p>The next step of the writing process is editing. This is the process of making sure that your assignment has all the necessary parts:</p><ul><li><p>Have you included all the information required for your assignment?</p></li><li><p>Does a separate title page, abstract, and reference sheet follow a format acceptable to your client or publisher?</p></li><li><p>Have citations been used correctly?</p></li></ul><p>Editing looks at sentence structure and clarity. Proofreading focuses on grammar errors, removing typos and adherence to a style guide.</p><p>We recommend editing first, then proofreading last because this allows for more flexibility when going through the editing process – if something needs changing after careful proofreading, you can do it without having to re-edit the whole thing again!</p><p>The proofreading stage is a final check that your essay is ready to be handed in. You can do this yourself or ask someone else to look at it.</p><h2><strong>Step 8: Proofread your final draft</strong></h2><p>Now that you\'ve made the big changes (editing), we need to focus on proofreading. In this section, we\'ll talk about what small errors to look for and how software can help with proofreading.</p><p>Before you send your work out into the world, it\'s important to check for those pesky little errors that can make your readers cringe. These include things like sentence fragments and sentence structure issues.</p><p>Small mistakes like these are easy enough to fix by hand, but if they pile up or are too numerous, they will impede readability and make people question whether they can trust your writing as a whole.</p><p>Luckily there are plenty of tools out there that can help with proofreading edits. Grammarly is one option that works well on both web browsers and word-processing software like Google Docs. It does a great job of editing and proofreading and making sure your writing is grammatically correct.</p><p>Pro Writing Aid also does a good job of flagging common mistakes. Microsoft Office lets you automatically underline spelling mistakes in red so that no one has any excuse not to fix them immediately before hitting publish.</p><p>The most important thing when proofreading is to read your work out loud. This helps you catch any errors that might not be obvious when reading silently in your head.</p><p>If you get stuck on a sentence or paragraph, try reading it backward or changing the tense of verbs. This can often help you access new meaning in old text.</p><p>Once you\'ve completed this final step, you have your final draft ready to submit.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>You have your eight steps! Make sure you follow them whether you\'re writing a shorts social media post or a huge dissertation. These steps work, period.

The resume is only half of a copywriter&rsquo;s application. Copywriters also submit portfolios of their work so hiring managers can see their abilities in action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some steps to maximise your copywriting abilities when creating your resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most businesses use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to make hiring more efficient. For candidates, the ATS will automatically screen your resume and either send it to a hiring manager or eliminate it from the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as you would use keywords to boost the SEO of an article, you need to use the appropriate keywords to ensure your application makes it through the initial vetting stage. Most businesses looking for a copywriter will have some combination of these keywords in their ATS:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Writing</li>\r\n	<li>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</li>\r\n	<li>Keyword research</li>\r\n	<li>WordPress / Microsoft Word&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Creative</li>\r\n	<li>Editing</li>\r\n	<li>Style guides</li>\r\n	<li>Open-minded</li>\r\n	<li>Marketing</li>\r\n	<li>Independent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Start your resume with a summary of your professional identity and include these keywords to appease the ATS and get to the human hiring stage. The section of your resume dedicated to your skills is also an excellent opportunity to use more of these important keywords.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#212529; font-style:normal\">Highlight skills</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can highlight your relevant skills in your resume&rsquo;s introductory summary and the &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; section. The summary is an excellent place to write about your in-depth knowledge of programs like <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/wordpress\">WordPress</a> and<a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/grammarly\"> Grammarly</a>. You can also reference your understanding of the importance of SEO and keyword research in this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; portion of your resume should be single words that describe your abilities without further context. Keywords in this section can relate more to your personal attributes than industry-specific terms. Highlight that you are open-minded, creative, and detail-oriented.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#212529; font-style:normal\">Customise applications&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Customising your application to the role might sound obvious, but hiring managers dismiss many resumes for being too vague. Using the company&rsquo;s name and the position you&rsquo;re interested in shows the hiring manager that you are a serious candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copywriting is a vast field. You can specialise in almost any subject, so ensure your resume is specific to the job. Some businesses need technical writers who can produce compelling copy for industries like engineering, medicine, and finance. Other companies, however, are looking for writers who can research and investigate a range of topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be a great copywriter who can excel in both types of content creation. Hiring managers only want to know about your suitability for the role they offer. Highlight skills that are most relevant to the job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#212529; font-style:normal\">Reference portfolios</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Resumes are one component of a copywriter&rsquo;s job application, while portfolios comprise the other half. Your portfolio demonstrates that you can produce high-quality, compelling content that fits your client&rsquo;s brief. Hiring managers want proof that you can deliver on the skills and experience you mention in your resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many copywriting roles will ask for a portfolio when you apply, but you should provide it whether or not they ask. If you have an online portfolio, attach a link to your resume so the hiring manager can access your past samples immediately.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experienced copywriters might have multiple portfolios or pages to keep their work organised by industry or style. If you have a range of portfolios to show, only send the one most relevant to the job. Hiring managers spend lots of time sorting through applications, so making it as quick and easy as possible is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"color:#212529; font-style:normal\">Proofread thoroughly</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, proofread your resume. This step also sounds obvious, but we all know how easily a typo can slip through the cracks. If you&rsquo;re sending out various applications customised to their businesses and roles, it&rsquo;s even easier to make a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proofreading is a core skill for copywriters. If you send a resume that proudly boasts your detail-oriented work but is filled with errors and typos, it won&rsquo;t look good. It&rsquo;s well worth reading your resume a second and third time to ensure you&rsquo;re putting your best foot forward.</p>', '2023-04-19 08:37:55', '2023-04-19 08:37:55'),

They can also help your career in journalism and other media fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, writing feature stories is not as easy as it sounds &ndash; you need to find an interesting topic, research it, interview people involved in the story, write up your research and make it interesting for readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll look at how to do all these steps successfully so you can write your own great feature story!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The value of feature stories</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A feature story is a long, in-depth article usually written by a single reporter. Feature stories are often (but not always) accompanied by pictures and graphics. They&#39;re typically published in the local newspaper or magazine section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &quot;feature&quot; can be confusing because it means both &quot;special&quot; and &quot;characteristic.&quot; Features can be about people, places, events or ideas&mdash;but whatever they are about should have special significance for your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a recent local story about an alligator living in Lake Ontario was considered newsworthy because of its novelty value (it&#39;s never happened before). Still, it doesn&#39;t focus on anything specific about gators, lakes, or Toronto that would make this topic particularly interesting to the readership. So we wouldn&#39;t consider running it as a feature story (even though the piece was well-written).</p>', '2023-04-18 13:11:11', '2023-04-18 13:11:11'),
(21, 53, 'Feature ideas', '1', 'feature-ideas', '<h2><strong>Feature ideas</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Feature story ideas are everywhere. The trick is finding them. Here are some of my favorite ways to find story ideas:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Current events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways to find story ideas is to find a current event that is interesting to people. A feature would be a longer follow-up piece to the breaking story. A follow-up to a breaking story or an exclusive will likely interest a major outlet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Most readers are interested in people</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People are interesting. Therefore, the best feature story ideas focus on interesting people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are more interesting than places and things. An interesting person trumps events, ideas, facts and data &mdash; so think about how you can make your story about them (and not just what they did).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Listen to the people around you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A great place to start is the people around you. Listen to your friends and family because they are often a good source of inspiration. They will be able to tell you about their own experiences with whatever topic you&#39;re interested in, and these stories can make for good storytelling material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also listen to people that aren&#39;t in your life all that much, e.g., those who work at the grocery store or drive an ice cream truck down your street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more time you spend observing others, the more likely you might find something interesting about their lives or jobs that could spark feature story ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it&#39;s important not only to listen but take note of what you&#39;re hearing. Write down good ideas as they come up, so there&#39;s no chance of forgetting them when it comes time for brainstorming sessions later on down the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Search for topics using keyword tools</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you start researching a topic, you&#39;ll want to use keyword tools to find the most popular keywords for that topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A keyword tool will give you a quick overview of what people are searching for about your topic and how many searches there are for each term. These are valuable metrics because they show what consumers are interested in at any given time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you search &quot;how much money do artists make?&quot; on Google Trends, it gives a graph showing that this question has been asked frequently over the last year (and even longer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graph also shows how often people searched for each variation of this question, like &quot;how much money do writers make?&quot; or &quot;what&#39;s an artist&#39;s salary.&quot; This is helpful information when deciding which idea is best suited for your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Attend cultural events in your community</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Attending cultural events in your community is a great way to find story ideas.

Cold emails are unsolicited emails, which could be sent for almost any reason. Look through your own emails, you are sure to have a few in your inbox at all times, whether they are sales emails or cold outreach emails. You will likely be able to tell us the subject lines.

A cold email campaign has all of the benefits cold calling used to have, without half of the drawbacks. Cold emailing allows a business to make first contact with a large body of potential clients, without having to manually begin the sales process anew with each new potential customer. It is more proactive and less static than something like a blog post, which relies on traffic coming to it. Instead, cold emails can go direct<em>&nbsp;to</em>&nbsp;your target audience. It is, therefore, a highly time-efficient method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a highly efficient way to reach a target audience, as it allows for a copywriter to write one email, and then use it to cast a wide net reaching potential customers. From there, WIT those not interested will generally not, allowing the copywriter to then narrow down their focus and conduct follow-ups with those interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good cold email campaign can also increase brand awareness; even if a potential customer does not respond directly to the e-mail, they are now aware of the brand and may consider it when they are in need of the product or service the company provides in the future.</p>', '2023-04-19 01:59:12', '2023-04-19 01:59:12');

Follow these do&#39;s and don&#39;ts and you will be writing engaging, successful cold emails that will grab readers&#39; attention, and turn them into customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do Hook Them In</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to successful cold email campaigns lies in an effective subject line. The subject line is the first point of contact, the subject line must<em>&nbsp;grab the reader&#39;s attention</em>. It must frame what it is you are selling, and the essentials of what you want to get across while remaining simple and efficient. Research suggests 47% of recipients open emails entirely based on the quality of the subject line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t fall into the trap of trying to include everything in the subject line, bombarding the reader with information. Think about what it is that is most appealing about the product or service in question, and try to write something that distils what is being offered in as succinct language as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try using an open-ended question in your subject line or opening lines. Or highlight a pain point for customers of competition, and imply that a solution to this lies within the email body. Ensure those opening lines are strong and quick to the point, as they will show after the title in the recipient&#39;s inbox. Once you have them hooked, then you can elaborate, but for now, keep it short and sweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do Establish Credibility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst thing that can happen to your carefully crafted email is for it to end up in the spam folder. Or, for your subject line or opening lines of the email itself to be so suspect and full of spam words that it may as well end up in the spam folder. Avoid phrases like &#39;100% per cent satisfaction guaranteed. Avoid suspicious words, and under no circumstances should there be grammatical errors!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credibility can also be established by adopting the correct tone of voice. A B2B email should be more formal, and professional. It can be more data-driven, showing the results and the hard proof is more likely to entice a business, driven by the bottom line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas the email body for a B2C campaign can afford to adopt a more personal, familiar tone. It should appeal to the reader as a person, and read as though it is&nbsp;<em>from&nbsp;</em>a real person. This is a key component of a good cold email; it must have a touch of humanity. Recipients don&#39;t like to feel as if they&#39;re receiving automated, robotic stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personalized emails will always have an advantage over impersonal, generic ones. So take your time in writing it, and think about what it is that is appealing about your product or service to a potential customer, and accentuate it, to appeal to their needs and wants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are also advised to include the company name, and contact details in the email signature. Include a link to the company&#39;s landing page or a link to a blog post. Transparency is key to establishing credibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do Include A Call To Action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Any good sales pitch should include a call to action. You could have written the most compelling email body possible, but if there is no call to action followed by a simple and clear link to getting the reader started down that path, then it was all for nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Include links to a blog post, or reviews of the product on a trustworthy site, showing social proof of a real person showing the product or service&#39;s value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don&#39;t End Up In The Spam Folder!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the absolute most important mistake you cannot afford to make. Unfortunately, sometimes, it may happen, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t do everything possible to prevent it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, but for understandable reasons, email providers do not disclose what dictates their spam filters, so understanding how to avoid being consigned to the spam folder isn&#39;t an exact science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t make outrageous claims in your subject line or body email. Make sure you make it possible for the recipient to reply to the email, as reply rates factor into whether an email will be considered spam or not going forward. Encourage readers to add the sender&#39;s email to their address book, which will prevent any future emails from being sent to spam or junk folders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid all capitals in the subject line or opening lines, and make sure the email feels personalised enough so that the recipient doesn&#39;t just assume it is random spam not intended for them specifically. Do all of this and your cold email copywriting will be done the justice it deserves by seeing the light of day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don&#39;t Be Vague</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to the CTA mentioned earlier, cold emails cannot afford to be vague. The subject lines should be simple, but it should be clear who the target audience is. If this sound tricky, it&#39;s because it is; writing a simple subject line (and email copywriting in general) that is compelling is an art, but it is also essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, the subject lines or the opening lines of your cold email should identify pain points, the body email should include social proof, value proposition, and should read as though it was written by a real person for a real person. This may sound silly, but too often cold emails can read like they were simply generated, and don&#39;t take time to communicate the way a real person would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leave out the boring stuff, vague descriptions and promises; be direct, concise, and compelling. Writing good cold emails is about sharpening what you have to say to its finest point. Your entire cold email should in a sense be a call to action generally, punctuated with a specific, easily followable call to action at the end. Don&#39;t hit at the general direction of the site, provide landing pages, or for example a blog post you recently wrote for your client, identify a unique pain point and demonstrate the solution to it;&nbsp;<em>be specific.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don&#39;t Forget Follow Ups</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is key. Cold email campaigns are, in the best-case scenario, just the beginning of an ongoing relationship between your client and their customer, with you as a silent middleman. Keep track of your response rate, conduct follow-ups, and obtain reviews for further social proof, learning lessons from every negative and positive response will allow you to build on your momentum going forward. All of this also helps your future emails continue to avoid the spam filter. Get feedback, and ensure your target audience is being reached.</p>', '2023-04-19 08:41:57', '2023-04-19 08:41:57'),

You can expect an additional cash compensation of $5,000, which takes the total to $74,450.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the hourly rate for the lowest, medium, and highest copywriter categories is $15 an hour, $30 an hour, and $55 an hour, respectively. This means the highest copywriter salary is $121,600 a year, the medium of $62,000 a year, and the lowest is $31,700 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much do copywriters make in the UK?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The average salary of a copywriter is lower in the UK compared to the copywriter salaries in the US, starting from a low of &pound;25,000 for junior copywriters and &pound;30,000 for medium-level copywriters. Senior copywriters can expect to make around &pound;45,000 or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much do copywriters make in Australia?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Copywriters in Australia have higher average salaries than their counterparts in the US and UK. A junior copywriter can expect an average salary of $76,000 a year. The medium-level copywriters make around $87,000 annually, while the senior copywriters earn an average of $122,000. The copywriter&#39;s salaries are also subject to location and industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How much do copywriters make in Canada?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A junior copywriter in Canada with less than one year of experience can expect an annual salary of C$41,000. A medium-level copywriter can expect to earn C$57,000, while a senior copywriter can earn up to C$105,000. All these averages include tips, bonuses, and overtime pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Do copywriters in different branches and locations have different salaries?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Copywriter salary by location</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with the copywriter salaries you may expect, it&rsquo;s time to find out your earning potential in different fields of copywriting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a &#39;write for fun&#39; type of copywriter or a workaholic copywriter, how much you earn will greatly impact your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two main factors responsible for a copywriter&#39;s salary difference are location and experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a junior copywriter in a big city like New York can make $61,000 a year on average. In contrast, a junior copywriter in a smaller city will earn $42,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, a senior copywriter in New York will make $93,000 a year, and if the same copywriter is based in a smaller city, he will earn $65,000 a year on average.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at these numbers, you can understand that a copywriter&#39;s salary in a small town is in a comfortable range, while in a bigger city, it&rsquo;s a lucrative one (although living in a big city is more expensive).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with the increase in remote working, the lines have blurred, and a copywriter can expect a good, big-city salary and still work wherever he wishes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Copywriter salary by different branches</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a copywriter, you can be one of these three:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Agency copywriter</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In-house copywriter</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Freelance copywriter&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Copywriters usually start by working with an agency for a couple of years. They then move on to being an in-house copywriter. Later, when they have more experience, they may branch out on their own and work as a freelancer or have their own agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Agency copywriter salary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing and advertising agencies offer a great place to network and learn on the job. You can expect a good entry-level copywriter salary if you work for a competitive, successful agency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average salary for a junior copywriter is $47,000, and a senior copywriter working for an agency can expect an average salary of $88,000 (both estimates are for the US).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There isn&#39;t much data on average senior copywriter salaries because copywriters rarely stay long enough with an agency to reach seniority levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>In-house copywriter salary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working as an in-house copywriter offers mid-career salaries. In-house copywriters usually move towards marketing. You can position yourself to get lucrative offers from competing firms for your skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days it is in the copywriter&#39;s best interests to move jobs to increase their salaries, as there are few chances of getting more than a couple of promotions. Also, the business you&rsquo;re working for as an in-house copywriter won&#39;t think twice about letting you go for their financial benefit if they need to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want a steady, long-term paycheck and you&rsquo;re not ambitious enough to freelance or have your own agency, being an in-house copywriter could be the best job for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the US, the average salary of a junior copywriter is $48,000 a year, and a senior copywriter can expect to make $85,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Freelance copywriter salary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The possibility of remote work has made freelance copywriting more doable for copywriters. It&rsquo;s ideal for a freelance copywriter to work at an agency initially to make contacts and gain experience. Freelancing may offer the highest pay with the least work for a copywriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s best to remember that once you decide to freelance, you are on your own. There are no healthcare benefits, you have to pay full taxes, and no 401K matching/retirement contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A freelance copywriter&rsquo;s salary is not dependent on a copywriter&#39;s junior or senior level. It depends on how many products/services you can sell your copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While entry-level freelance copywriters struggle to make $20,000 a year, seasoned copywriters have been known to scale around $150,000 a year and more.&nbsp;</p>', '2023-04-19 03:03:31', '2023-04-19 03:03:31'),

(100, 62, 'Productivity Tips', '1', 'productivity-tips', '<h2><strong>Explore our best productivity tips for copywriters and discover what can make you a better writer.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Start the day right</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Boost your productivity by starting your day on a positive note. Walking outside at the start of your day is a great way to find some inspiration and get your blood pumping. Copywriting is a sedentary job unless you have a treadmill desk. Jobs that involve lots of sitting increase your likelihood of <a href=\"https://healthy-workplaces.eu/en/about-topic/priority-area/sedentary-work#:~:text=Many%20jobs%20involve%20prolonged%20sitting,as%20diabetes%20and%20heart%20disease.\">developing musculoskeletal disorders</a>, so getting adequate exercise is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reading also sparks your creativity and gets your mind up and running, ready for a day of excellent writing. Podcasts are an ideal alternative if you want to walk and listen &zwnj;or prefer listening to reading. Find a novel or some non-fiction writing that fascinates you. Progressing more each day provides excellent structure and excitement to your mornings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, get your breakfast right. You don&rsquo;t have to eat a big breakfast to start your day. Some people find that large meals at the start of the day leave them feeling sluggish and ready to lie down. Instead, choose a balanced option that gives you the fuel to be productive. Writers are renowned for their love of coffee, but you need food to think properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Prioritise and plan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fail to prepare, and you prepare to fail. The old saying is correct: planning your day is crucial to productivity. Block your time in the day so you don&rsquo;t have to guess what you should do next. Having a plan for the day makes it much easier to stay on track and avoid distractions while you write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of eating the frog, now&rsquo;s the time. The concept comes from <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/168105-eat-a-live-frog-first-thing-in-the-morning-and\">Mark Twain</a>, who wrote that if you ever had to eat a live frog, it&rsquo;s best to do it first thing in the morning as nothing worse will happen to you all day. For productive copywriting, this means tackling your &lsquo;scariest&rsquo; task first. Plan your day so that the most extensive, intimidating work comes first and the rest of your day is a breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only time Eat The Frog doesn&rsquo;t apply is when you have deadlines to meet. Organise your work according to when it&rsquo;s due to avoid last-minute stress writing. You become a more productive copywriter when you learn how to prioritise your workflow effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Separate tasks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Divide your tasks into their subsections to increase your productivity in each section. For example, completing the first drafts is a priority if you have three blogs to write. Edit them later to create some separation and give you a cleaner insight into their quality. Proofreading is more efficient and manageable when you&rsquo;ve had a proper break from the words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For freelance copywriters, limit communication with clients to a specific section of the day. For example, if you write in the morning, contact your clients in the early afternoon, and then edit and proofread your work, you clearly define each task. Set firm boundaries with your clients so they understand you aren&rsquo;t available 24/7 to reduce stress and boost productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to separate your tasks is by setting small deadlines for yourself. For example, long-form writing with distant deadlines is easy to procrastinate. Rather than face the stress and low-quality work of last-minute writing, create deadlines for yourself to space out the work. It makes you more productive, and your writing is of higher quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Cultivate a productive atmosphere</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Writers know too well the importance of a good atmosphere. Ambience is subjective, so you must find something that works for you. Some people prefer to write in silence to concentrate, while others prefer background music. You can play the sound of a hairdryer or even ambient birdsong if it helps - find what works for you and enables you to concentrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some copywriters, working in public is the best way to feel productive. Whether it&rsquo;s the energy of the world around you, or the perceived pressure of being watched, writing in public can increase your productivity massively. Try writing in a local cafe or park to combine fresh air with work and see if it helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who work remotely from their homes can improve their productivity by setting boundaries with family members. Clearly (and politely) communicate your working schedule to family members/housemates so they know not to disturb you to ease your workflow. Working without sudden interruptions will improve the quality and quantity of your writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Set goals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your writing is more productive and consistent when you have a daily word count you want to reach. Setting a goal like this pushes you to work harder and get more done daily. Be realistic about your word count and ensure it&rsquo;s a target you can consistently reach daily (5,000 words a day is not realistic).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, challenging yourself to produce a certain number of blogs in a week keeps you focused on your big-picture goals. Establish how many blogs you can comfortably create in a week with the right atmosphere and work setup. It is significantly easier to work consistently with a concrete idea of how much you know you can produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also get a confidence boost on days and weeks when you go over your word count or weekly blog target. Those &lsquo;big win&rsquo; days motivate you to keep pushing yourself and striving for increased productivity whilst maintaining the integrity and quality of your writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Use productivity tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant writing hacks that can increase your productivity is utilising digital and practical productivity tools. Strict Workflow is a plugin for your web browser that eliminates distractions. Click the tomato icon to block distracting sites for 25 minutes, after which you can click again for 5 minutes of full access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cornerstone of any writer&rsquo;s toolkit is Grammarly. This editing software reduces editing and proofreading time, giving you more time to create. You can customise your feedback based on your target audience and language preferences. Grammarly also highlights elements like passive voice many writers miss in their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more practical hack that doesn&rsquo;t need a tool is removing your phone from the equation. If you&rsquo;re entering a long block of writing, you might even want to switch to aeroplane mode. You can work much more productively without the distraction of your phone. Set it to silent, screen-side down, and keep it away from your computer for best results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Take breaks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective productivity is as much about working as it is about resting. Your mind can only create high-quality work for so long before it needs a break. Exercise by walking after lunch to refresh your mind and allow your body to stretch and move before returning to work. Yoga or stretching is another good way to promote your blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re social, a midday break is perfect for a quick phone call to catch up with friends and family. Relaxing for a period in the middle of your day breaks up the periods of concentration and makes it easier to focus again afterwards. A lunch date can combine the need for fresh air, socialisation, and fuel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, relaxing in isolation will benefit some writers more. Take a break to meditate partway through your day to boost your productivity. Clearing your mind and letting thoughts flow naturally through your head clears your head like a walk might.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Experiment with your schedule</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These hacks are helpful, but ultimately you need to configure your schedule to suit you best. Some writers find that working through the night makes them more productive and creative. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/9494.H_P_Lovecraft#:~:text=No%20one%20knows%20whether%20or,has%20tried%20writing%20at%20night.%E2%80%9D\">H. P. Lovecraft</a> once wrote, &lsquo;No one knows whether or not he is a writer unless he has tried writing at night&rsquo;. Try it to see if it improves your work and mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, waking up much earlier than usual and writing can leave you feeling accomplished. Finishing your work day when most people have lunch gives you the rest of the day to unwind, leaving you refreshed for the next day. Early birds and night owls should try these methods before writing themselves off as &lsquo;bad writers&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experiment with moving different tasks around within your work day to perfect your schedule. Writing first is best for some people, while others prefer to finish their day with writing assignments. Improving your productivity is much easier once you&rsquo;ve established a pattern you enjoy most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These hacks can all have a positive effect on your writing and your work life. Copywriting can be freeing and enjoyable if you find the methods that work for you. At The Author&rsquo;s Pad, we can advise on the best tools for copywriters and how to make the most of your time to boost your copywriting career.</p>', '2023-04-19 02:49:49', '2023-04-19 02:49:49'),

If you&rsquo;re unsure about something in your brief, asking your client about it saves more time than trying to figure it out alone. Another mistake is neglecting your optimisation, which is crucial for effective copy. Finally, misusing words and industry terms is an error that you can avoid with research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why do most copywriters fail?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The copywriters who fail usually lack either confidence or ability. Training and practise can improve your writing abilities to make you a stronger copywriting, but confidence is all on you. Believing in yourself is essential to making it as a copywriter. If you practise your writing, you&rsquo;ll probably notice you become more confident as a result of your experience level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the biggest challenge in copywriting?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dealing with clients is one of the hardest parts of copywriting, from getting contracts with them to negotiating elements of the work. Other challenges copywriters face include: competitive environment, time management, difficult research, and motivation. If you can properly manage your time, the other challenges become easier to manage as well.</p>', '2023-04-19 02:50:20', '2023-04-19 02:50:20'),

Clients will value a mediocre freelance copywriter with in depth knowledge of their industry. They will always outperform a gifted copywriter who has basic or no knowledge of an industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, you lose major credibility if you say you can &#39;write anything.&#39; Clients don&#39;t want to teach freelance copywriters the basics of their industry. They want a good copywriter who can hit the ground running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly every single successful freelance copywriter with a long-established copywriting career has niched down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps you&#39;re a fan of keeping fit. You can now speak knowledgeably to copywriting clients in the fitness industry. Or you could write for adjacent industries such as wellness or supplements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you&#39;re a female copywriter who&#39;s passionate about women&#39;s issues? You can write copy that proves your expertise to clients focusing on marketing to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have a degree in accountancy but hate the idea of becoming an accountant? You can impress accountancy firms with your grasp of accounting terminology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clients like hiring writers they feel instantly comfortable with because they &#39;get&#39; them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2) Research the freelance copywriting market</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve niched, to become a copywriter in demand, you need to find out what genuine paying clients in this area want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is easy as all you have to do is look for freelance writer jobs or gigs online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some platforms to find great copywriting job offers are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Indeed</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Mediabistro</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Problogger</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Journalismjobs</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Freelancewritinggigs</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>BloggingPro</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To make it as easy as possible for you, &lt;NAME OF OUR PLATFORM&gt; goes through all the above sites and more to create a list of copywriting job offers in one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These adverts will tell you what paying clients in your chosen industry want from freelance copywriters. The best adverts will also give you lots of information about the companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3) Focus on a particular copywriting service</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When starting as a freelance copywriter, it could be tempting to say you can write &#39;anything.&#39; You just want to get started, and you&#39;re happy to turn your hand to articles, landing pages, adverts, emails, video scripts, product pages, ad copywriting, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a &#39;jack of all trades&#39; does not inspire confidence in potential clients. That will make you a mediocre freelance copywriter. Become a copywriter who&#39;s an expert in a particular service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good copywriter will specialise in one or two copywriting services. For example, a direct response copywriter is skilled at improving conversions on a landing or sales page. It&#39;s &#39;direct response&#39; because a customer takes action immediately after reading. The action could be leaving an email address, booking a call, or buying something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct response copywriting is a different skill compared to, for example, blog post writing or email marketing. Email marketing copywriters tend to focus on building momentum for sales over time. Blog post writers concentrate on keeping the reader on the site for as long as possible (for SEO ranking). Almost every successful copywriter has niched down into a particular area of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you focus on a particular form of copywriting, you can quickly become a copywriter with an expert reputation. That&#39;s because you&#39;ll be doing the same thing again and again. You can&#39;t become great at something when you&#39;re learning a multitude of other skills at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the market research you did earlier and your copywriting preferences to niche into one or two key services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4) Read copywriting books to learn copywriting</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ve already stated that you don&#39;t need formal training to be a great copywriter. However, you can&#39;t expect to get paid copywriting jobs if you don&#39;t know anything about copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good copywriter understands their job is to make their clients money by persuading people to buy from these clients. This differs from content writing for brand awareness, relationship building, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better your copywriting skills, the more money you make for them. This means you can command more money too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The copywriting world has some famous copywriters who have written books on writing copy designed to persuade. This is a cost-effective way to learn copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some recommendations:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The Gary Halbert Letter - Gary Halbert</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Scientific Advertising - Claude Hopkins</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Breakthrough Advertising - Eugene Schwartz</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Ogilvy on Advertising - David Ogilvy</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Tested Advertising Methods - John Caples</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Integrated Marketing Communications - Don Schultz</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Advertising Secrets of the Written Word - Joseph Sugarman</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Copy Logic! - Mike Palmer and Michael Masterson</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>The Copywriter&#39;s Handbook - Robert Bly</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, if you followed the earlier step and focused on a particular copywriting service, look for books that teach this. For example, The Ultimate Sales Letter by Dan Kennedy is a must-read if you wish to become a direct response copywriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep this in mind if you&#39;re worried that some of the recommended books are decades old. Human psychology has remained unchanged for centuries. The medium we use to communicate may change, but the vast majority of the psychology involved is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that some of these copywriting greats in the list above are dead and buried. It&#39;s irrelevant that they were writing for print when we are focused on online copywriting. The key skills required to persuade a person to buy from a particular company, brand or person remain unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5) Take a copywriting course</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of courses out there that help you with the foundations of copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure your chosen copywriting course is taught by a professional copywriter. They must have proven experience and success in copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, you don&#39;t need any experience to become a copywriter. That&#39;s great for you. But it also means people without many copywriting skills can create copywriting courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some recommendations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) American Writers &amp; Artists Institute</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of the world&#39;s leading copywriting training programs. They attract some heavyweight copywriters who create programs for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their vast library means you can find the perfect copywriting course for your chosen copywriting form. However, be aware that many of their programs can be expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) &#39;Success Works&#39; Copywriting Course</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a three-month course that focuses on SEO copywriting. It&#39;s by Heather Lloyd-Martin, a copywriter that Forbes describes as &lsquo;the pioneer&#39; of SEO copywriting. As Google is such a huge factor in the success of most businesses, most copywriters need SEO knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) {Our program - add name when we have it}</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course will show you how to write converting and SEO-optimised copy and gain clients. You&#39;ll also learn pricing strategies and negotiation skills. This will help you build a successful copywriting business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s something many people forget when looking to become a copywriter. They focus on learning copywriting and getting clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the most successful copywriters don&#39;t have a tonne of clients. The best copywriters have a small number of clients who pay them well. This program will show you how to achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) The Blackford Centre</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This copywriting course not only teaches you great copywriting, but you&#39;ll also learn how to run a freelance writing business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re also assigned a tutor who will keep you on track. This is great for anyone who struggles to motivate themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) Sell Like Hell</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a course from renowned copywriter Carmine MasterPierro. It focuses on sales conversion copy, so it&#39;s ideal if you want to get into the direct response form of copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6) Transmedia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is for those who wish to work as an in house copywriter for corporates. You&#39;ll learn how to write effective copy by understanding branding and corporate identity. This allows you to pursue corporate copywriter jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6) Start writing!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s incredible how many people want to become a copywriter, yet they don&#39;t write regularly. They don&#39;t even keep a diary!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, a copywriting career has an element of &#39;learning on the job&#39;. But no client will be happy for you to learn basic copywriting techniques on their dime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reading books and doing copywriting courses will give you the theory, but then you need to put it into practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not start writing copy for your own blog or website showcasing what you&#39;ve learnt so far? In a matter of weeks, you could have a simple copywriting portfolio, despite having no clients. You can also offer to write for small websites and bloggers for free. The added benefit is that you get valuable feedback on your writing style and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most copywriters think of their writing skills as a muscle. If it&#39;s not used, it will atrophy. Even when no money is involved, most writers will still write, even if it&#39;s for nobody&#39;s eyes but their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&#39;t know where to start, here&#39;s a trick made famous by Gary Halbert, one of the world&#39;s best-known copywriters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Search for copywriting content that you like</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What content has stopped you in your tracks? What content made you want to buy, sign up, book an appointment, etc.? Look at your own online behaviour to pick content that persuaded you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something the best copywriters do is to create a &#39;swipe file&#39; of great copywriting they come across. It&#39;s called a swipe file because it&#39;s the ideal place to &#39;swipe&#39; some inspiration when you&#39;re struck with writer&#39;s block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a folder where you can bookmark great sales pages, landing pages, blog posts or adverts as and when you discover them online. Create a folder in your email inbox to save great emails that made you take action of some sort. All social media platforms have a &#39;save&#39; function where you can save great posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within weeks you will have built up a portfolio of fantastic copywriting to inspire you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Copy the content you find, word for word</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point of this strategy is that, while you&#39;re copying down the content, you not only learn good copywriting, you keep it long-term. Perhaps you remember revising for exams when you were in school. We bet you couldn&#39;t just read a textbook and expect to do well. In most cases, revising involves writing. The act of writing helps you to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some proponents of this tactic insist on writing copy with pen and paper. Others have reported good results by typing on a keyboard. Whether you write copy or type, either will be much better than simply reading great copywriting and expecting it to sink into your brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find some great copywriting and start writing or typing it, word for word. Set aside an hour a day to do this, and, within weeks, you will have tuned your brain on what is converting, persuasive copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan Kennedy (one of the world&#39;s highest-paid copywriters) has written over 500 sales letters. Of course, this copied content should not go on your public blog or website, if you have one, as you are copying someone else&#39;s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Create &#39;better&#39; versions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to write better versions of the content you&#39;ve found. How could you have made it even more appealing? Could a punchier email subject line have increased open rates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter, at this stage, whether your version is better. Just trying to &#39;outdo&#39; great copywriting hones your skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also showcase this work on your blog or website. You could even do explanation articles with side-by-side comparisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the world&#39;s best copywriters with decades of experience still have swipe files. They add any content that inspires them to keep learning and stay at the top of their game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above steps are the inside secret on how to become a copywriter with no experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6) Apply for freelance copywriter jobs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have some copywriting skills and a portfolio of work, it&#39;s time to pitch yourself to clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use&nbsp;&lt;NAME OF OUR PLATFORM&gt; to go through all the major job sites and create a list of copywriting job offers that appeal to you. Now, start applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where our earlier advice of niching down into an industry and copywriting form will help you stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most writers have CVs that scream &#39;generalist.&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine your chosen industry is finance, and you&#39;re specialising in direct response copywriting. You see an advert for a landing page copywriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of your competition will send prospective clients CVs and portfolios with all kinds of work. You can direct them to your blog/website, where you have many landing page examples in the finance sector. Perhaps you&#39;ve even written a blog post on how to increase landing page conversions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clients are busy people. They don&#39;t want to wade through many applications to find the perfect person. People hire copywriters who can quickly prove they are the right person for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7) Make a &#39;can&#39;t say no&#39; offer to potential prospects</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your potential clients know they need a good copywriter. But saying yes is difficult. Will this person deliver what I want? How much time will I spend explaining things to them? Will they learn the ropes fast enough? Will I waste money and need to rehire? These are typical questions clients have when they&#39;re hiring a freelance copywriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stand head and shoulders above others, make them an offer they can&#39;t refuse by taking this pressure off them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Offer to write the first piece of copy for free. If they need an email marketing copywriter, offer to write an email sequence; if they don&#39;t like it, they don&#39;t have to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who can say no to this? They&#39;re not under any pressure to hire you without checking out what a great freelance copywriter you are. Any fears they have of wasting money, making the wrong choice and needing to rehire, or feeling like an idiot in front of their superiors vanishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note. Don&#39;t offer to do huge jobs for free. We&#39;re talking about a small email sequence, a landing page (not a big sales page), etc. Write copy that doesn&#39;t take you a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they say no, it&#39;s no big deal. You got in some copywriting practice, and the results can be used to bolster your portfolio on your own website or blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8) Partner with an influencer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This little-known tactic can quickly put you ahead of other writers, even writers with far more experience than you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have implemented the earlier steps, you will have determined your target prospect based on your industry/sector and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you need to find someone whose audience is full of these prospects. They could have a big following on social media, a high-traffic blog, an active email list, or a popular podcast. In other words, an influencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get in touch with them by offering to help them with something. Do not ask them for help. Don&#39;t ask them for anything - especially in the first email or message!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people think that influencers must get a ton of messages every day, and their messages will be ignored. They&#39;re right because most people send messages asking for something. They focus on &#39;what&#39;s in it for them&#39; instead of what the influencer needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine waking up to an inbox full of strangers wanting you to do stuff for them. How would it make you feel? This is a daily reality for influencers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, stand out by talking about how you can help them. Find out if they have problems that you can solve. Don&#39;t talk about yourself and what you want until they ask you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out their website, blog, social media presence, etc. Is there something you can improve? Offer to improve it for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join their email list and read their emails. Are there little tweaks you can do to increase conversions? If so, create a fantastic email autoresponder sequence and send it to them without expecting any payment. Or give them a list of great subject lines they can use for future emails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can help their blog convert better, or their sales page, homepage, adverts, social media posts, etc., don&#39;t tell them you can do it, just&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>it. Add value to their business and life without expecting anything in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will you stand out like a beacon in a sea of &#39;me, me, me&#39; messages, but most influencers will also feel compelled to help you and return the favour. After all, one good deed deserves another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you are in their good graces, they can introduce you to their audience. Perhaps they can email their list. Or they could interview you on their podcast, write a blog post or collaborate on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to sweeten the pot, you could offer them a small commission for every new client they send your way from their marketing efforts. This will entice them to promote you over and over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Email/message example</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi &lt;name&gt;,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love your website/podcast/blog/social media profile, etc. (delete as appropriate)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I particularly liked when you (mention something they said/wrote - this shows you&#39;re not sending a cut-and-paste message).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I couldn&#39;t help but notice (mention the small problem that you can help them with). I&#39;m a specialist in (your service) in (your industry), and I&#39;m sure I can increase your conversions with a few tweaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s what you can do:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(outline in bullets what they need to change - don&#39;t hold back, tell them everything - wow them with your knowledge)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use one or more of the above, let me know!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a great day,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(your name)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>9) Partner with an agency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another little-known tactic is to find online marketing agencies that will send you copywriting gigs. If you can partner up with a great one, it could be the speediest way to start your copywriting business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One option is to target dedicated copywriting agencies. However, please be aware that they will already have many agency copywriters on their books. This doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t get work from them. If they&#39;re a growing agency, where demand is outstripping capacity, they could still send you lots of work. But you need to be aware that you&#39;re competing with other writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cleverer tactic is to find other marketing agencies. They could do search engine optimization, website design, paid ads, social media marketing, etc. It doesn&#39;t matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to find agencies with clients that might need your copywriting skills. For example, it&#39;s easy for a web design agency to upsell copywriting to their clients. They&#39;re experts in design and the technical side of websites. They&#39;re not content experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to find an agency to partner with</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Use Google Maps or another online tool to find all the marketing agencies in your city or region.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Visit their offices to introduce yourself as a freelance copywriter looking for copywriting work. Visiting in person works far better than emailing or cold calling.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Make sure you regularly follow up with each agency.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This takes a little effort and tenacity. But all it takes is one busy marketing agency to choose you as their copywriter of choice, and you&#39;ll have a flood of regular copywriting gig offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>10) Network in successful copywriter groups</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many online groups dedicated to helping writers meet each other. You&#39;ll find groups on social media, such as Facebook and LinkedIn groups. You can also search for them on Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These groups can become a valuable place to pick up tips from more experienced writers. You&#39;ll also find they may post about writing opportunities. Why would they do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, writers are generally a nice bunch of people! But also, when a writer starts to become successful, they&#39;ll receive writing offers they don&#39;t have time to complete. Or they could receive offers that don&#39;t fit their style or niche of writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes sense for them to help these clients by finding an alternative writer.</p>', '2023-04-19 04:09:29', '2023-04-19 04:09:29'),

And how can you use your own authentic tone when writing?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The definition of tone,</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The dictionary meaning of tone is &quot;the attitude that a writer or speaker conveys.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you read an article about how to set up a home office, for example, you might feel that it&#39;s written in a friendly tone if the author seems happy and enthusiastic about setting up your new workspace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose you visit your local coffee shop and order one of their specialty drinks, say an iced caramel latte with two pumps of vanilla syrup and whipped cream drizzled on top.

When reading, make sure to check for any obvious errors in grammar and punctuation, typos, factual inaccuracies or discrepancies, as well as make sure all key messages are communicated correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be helpful to read out loud - this will allow you to easily pick up on any errors that your eyes may have missed and will let you hear the sentences and phrasing to make sure that it reads well and makes sense.

This means checking that all brand names, company titles, dates and numbers are consistent throughout the text and that any images used in the piece are of a good quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Check For Spelling and Grammar Errors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have read the piece and checked for consistency, it&#39;s time to double-check for any spelling or grammar errors.

This means making sure that all key messages are communicated correctly, and that the copy meets all the requirements set out in the brief. If there are any discrepancies or changes needed, these should be noted and highlighted prior to submitting the copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Check Your Links</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to check your links - this means ensuring that all links in the copy are functioning correctly and are taking readers to the correct page. It&#39;s important to double-check this before submitting, as any broken or incorrect links can have a negative impact on the overall effectiveness of the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also check that the anchor text you have chosen for your link is accurate, relevant, and flows well with the rest of the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.&nbsp; Check Your Formatting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step in your proofreading checklist should be to check the formatting. This means making sure that all headings, fonts, margins and spacing are consistent throughout the piece, as this can have a huge impact on the readability of the copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, return to the brief at this point and check whether there are any specific formatting requirements or guidelines that you need to adhere to - you can also use tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/titlecase\">TitleCase</a> to double-check the titles and headings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.&nbsp; Read with Fresh Eyes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after reading the piece multiple times, our eyes can become accustomed to seeing errors, typos or discrepancies that we may have missed the first time around. The best way to ensure accuracy is to read through the copy again with fresh eyes, preferably at least one day later. This will allow you to check it from a different perspective and pick up on any errors you may have overlooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2023-05-08 07:58:52', '2023-05-08 07:58:52'),

Here are some of the key benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating Quality Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A well-developed content strategy involves producing high-quality content that captures the attention of your intended audience. This makes it more likely for your content to be shared and for people to link back to it, which helps boost your SEO rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding Your Niche</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A content strategy can be helpful in identifying gaps in the market when creating content. By creating content to fill in these gaps, your posts can become more appealing to search engines and enhance your rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Optimising for Keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mentioned, identifying relevant keywords to include in your content is essential for SEO success. Content strategy helps you research which keywords are most popular and effective, thus enabling you to focus on using them in your copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good content strategy should also include finding ways to incorporate keywords into your content to make them more natural and less obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Analysing and Tracking Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure effective digital marketing, it is necessary to not only produce high-quality content and optimise for search engines but also evaluate and monitor the outcomes of your endeavours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This process assists in determining the effectiveness of content and identifying areas for potential improvement. You can use analytics tools such as Google Analytics to measure the success of your SEO copywriting campaigns and make adjustments accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Increased Visibility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Content that is created with an effective strategy has a higher chance of being seen by both users and search engines. This results in increased website visitors, leading to improved visibility and rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Higher Rankings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Content that is strategically created and optimised for SEO has a higher chance of being noticed by search engines and ranking well in search results pages. As a result, there is a rise in exposure and footfall, ultimately contributing to the expansion of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Better Engagement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Content created with an effective content strategy is more likely to be interesting and engaging to readers, which leads to better user engagement. This can lead to more shares and comments, which can help further boost your SEO rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating a Solid Strategy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To create a successful content strategy, you need to research, analyse, and plan. Researching popular topics with your target audience can help you create resonating content while analysing the competition and their keywords can determine which terms to focus on.

Start writing down any ideas that come to you. It&#39;s very important not to edit or censor your thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard the phrase, &quot;The only stupid question is the question that is never asked.&quot; This attitude is used in brainstorming sessions in forward-thinking businesses because self-censoring or self-editing could mean great questions or ideas are left unsaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fostering an environment where nothing is wrong and everyone feels encouraged to say whatever is on their mind means these businesses get the best ideas for products, services, improvements, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to adopt the same approach. There is no stupid idea, thought, or question at this stage of the writing process. Make a note of whatever comes to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find your mind is quicker than you can type or write (it often is) and you&#39;re worried you&#39;ll lose some thoughts before jotting down, use voice-activated note-taking apps or transcription apps, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://otter.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Otter.ai</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Organize the topics your brainstormed (pre-writing)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step in the writing process is about organizing your ideas into a logical order. The human brain does not think linearly. It tends to &#39;spark&#39; in different directions. It&#39;s why mind mapping was invented, as it mimics how a human brain thinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when it comes to writing, no matter how short or long a piece is, you need to organize it sequentially so it&#39;s easy for readers to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go through your list of brainstormed topics and work out the order they would naturally come in your piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Research your topics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This step in the writing process is about gathering information from various sources. This information-gathering stage is sometimes called pre-writing, and it helps you narrow down the list of topics you brainstormed before moving forward with drafting your writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be successful at this stage, consider these questions: What exactly do I want my readers to know? Who are my intended audience members? How can I best communicate my ideas in my writing so they&#39;re understandable and helpful?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there&#39;s a specific question at hand (e.g., &quot;Why do people use social media?&quot;), it may also be helpful to find out where other writers have looked into similar topics so they can give their take on them (e.g., &quot;What does Sally say about Facebook?&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of research is called secondary research because it involves looking into other people&rsquo;s work instead of primary sources such as original documents or interviews with experts who have knowledge about what we&rsquo;re studying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also important not to forget the breadth of sources available. Some helpful examples are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>academic journals (which contain peer-reviewed articles written by experts)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>websites maintained by organizations dedicated specifically to scientific inquiry (like NASA)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>newspaper articles written by journalists working at respected news outlets like The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is there&#39;s no shortage of information at your fingertips. The opposite is true. With super fast internet, we have a world of information, almost too much information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trick is to allot a certain amount of time to research. Otherwise, you risk &#39;going down the rabbit hole,&#39; losing hours (very easily done) without you accomplishing much writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spend a few minutes researching each topic you brainstormed to see if it&#39;s worthwhile to include, and if so, gather information about that topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Plan your structure and outline</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that you&#39;ve removed irrelevant topics and fleshed out the remaining topics, the next step in the writing process is to create an outline of your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outline lets readers follow along with what you&#39;re saying while they read, which makes your writing easier to read and more enjoyable for them (and keeps them from getting lost).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also gives you a clear idea of what topics need more explanation or support so that later on, you know where improvements are needed when it&#39;s time for revision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great structure for any length of writing to follow is:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduce your &#39;why&#39; of your piece. Why are you here? What are you going to talk about? For example, &quot;As Gen Z spends up to 6 hours a day on TikTok, is this video-sharing site a creative outlet or damaging mental health?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s all about &#39;setting out your stall&#39; - grabbing your readers&#39; attention by telling them exactly what you&#39;ll be discussing and why (and perhaps even the benefits for them)- important if you&#39;re writing something that may induce a sale).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Arguements/sup-topics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ve already organized your topics previously. This is where you list these topics into discrete categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in our Tiktok piece, the first category could be TikTok usage statistics, TikTok history, TikTok revenue, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second category could be stories and quotes from people who use TikTok and love it for allowing a creative outlet, finding new friends and a sense of community, learning new ideas, positive statistics, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third category could be mental health statistics regarding social media and young people, stories and quotes from people adversely affected by TikTok, etc. And so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s nothing worse than a piece of writing that ends abruptly (think about how you feel when a film ends like this).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summarise the main points of your writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the topic and who you&#39;re writing for, you may write the conclusion with a neutral tone so the reader can make up their mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or you could write a conclusion that leaves no doubt about which side you&#39;re on. Follow your client or publisher&#39;s guideline. Sometimes strong opinions are welcome. Other times, neutrality is key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that even though an outline seems set in stone at this point, it will probably change throughout the writing process as new ideas occur or as one topic becomes irrelevant after another develops further during drafting or revision (which we&#39;ll cover later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be frustrating if it means going back and changing everything again&mdash;but don&#39;t worry! If necessary, we&#39;ll show how easy it is once everything you&rsquo;ve written everything out. Just keep going until then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use numbers/bullets instead of long sentences when describing each paragraph. This makes it easier for readers to scan quickly since they don&#39;t need all those details immediately but want some sense of what topics you&rsquo;re discussing within each section before diving deeper into reading specific paragraphs themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can also help with keeping track of what you&#39;ve said in the outline if you need to look back on it later (which we highly recommend doing). Finally, using numbers/bullets instead of long sentences will keep your paragraphs shorter and easier for readers to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Write the first draft first (don&#39;t stop to edit)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step in the writing process is to begin writing your first draft. This means you don&rsquo;t stop for editing or proofreading during this process. Instead, you should write as quickly as possible without stopping for a set period (sometimes called free writing)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that because you&#39;ve followed the above steps, you won&#39;t experience what many amateur writers experience, which is racing to get down their ideas and thoughts before they slip away!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because you&rsquo;ve brainstormed, organized, researched and outlined, you&#39;re at a stage where ideas won&#39;t escape you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you still want to write the first draft quickly. If it helps, consider it a &lsquo;rough draft,&rsquo; not the final version you will submit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&#39;t want to edit because it slows down the writing process. Avoiding editing will help keep your mind focused on what matters most - developing an argument and conveying it effectively through language use (i.e., word choice). Editing is a step further down the line. Keep the different stages separate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this drafting stage, focus on getting your main idea across clearly rather than worrying about spelling or grammatical errors or ensuring every detail is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also important not to worry about the quality of your writing when beginning the first draft. This will only slow progress toward completing the assignment in time for submission requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus instead on developing one strong idea per paragraph that relates directly back to your overall topic sentence (which should come right after introductions).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Take a break, redraft and revise</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations! You&#39;ve written your first draft. The next step in the writing process? Set your document aside and let your brain rest for a bit. You&#39;ll be re-reading it with fresh eyes later, so don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t think of anything else to add at this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll also want to reread your first draft with an eye toward larger issues, such as structure and argument (does your writing make sense?) or style (is any of your writing unclear?). Once you&#39;ve done that, check in with yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does it feel like a strong and cohesive piece? Is there any additional evidence that you could add for support? If so, write those down before adding them to your writing later in this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, go through each paragraph individually and make revisions based on what needs improvement from an organizational standpoint, stylistic clarity and other problems identified during the editing tasks above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might also want to start thinking about what else you could add to your writing, such as figures, tables and other visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these can certainly be useful for some readers, they aren&#39;t necessary for all audiences&mdash;especially if the point you are trying to make doesn&#39;t rely on any data presented visually or otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So only use them if they add something to your writing or make your writing clearer and more readily understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re unsure whether your writing needs figures and tables, try reading it aloud. If it sounds choppy or confusing (or if you have to pause during the reading), then you may need to add some visual aids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Edit for sentence structure and clarity</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step of the writing process is editing. This is the process of making sure that your assignment has all the necessary parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Have you included all the information required for your assignment?</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Does a separate title page, abstract, and reference sheet follow a format acceptable to your client or publisher?</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Have citations been used correctly?</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Editing looks at sentence structure and clarity. Proofreading focuses on grammar errors, removing typos and adherence to a style guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend editing first, then proofreading last because this allows for more flexibility when going through the editing process &ndash; if something needs changing after careful proofreading, you can do it without having to re-edit the whole thing again!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proofreading stage is a final check that your essay is ready to be handed in. You can do this yourself or ask someone else to look at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 8: Proofread your final draft</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve made the big changes (editing), we need to focus on proofreading. In this section, we&#39;ll talk about what small errors to look for and how software can help with proofreading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you send your work out into the world, it&#39;s important to check for those pesky little errors that can make your readers cringe. These include things like sentence fragments and sentence structure issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small mistakes like these are easy enough to fix by hand, but if they pile up or are too numerous, they will impede readability and make people question whether they can trust your writing as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily there are plenty of tools out there that can help with proofreading edits. Grammarly is one option that works well on both web browsers and word-processing software like Google Docs. It does a great job of editing and proofreading and making sure your writing is grammatically correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pro Writing Aid also does a good job of flagging common mistakes. Microsoft Office lets you automatically underline spelling mistakes in red so that no one has any excuse not to fix them immediately before hitting publish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing when proofreading is to read your work out loud. This helps you catch any errors that might not be obvious when reading silently in your head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get stuck on a sentence or paragraph, try reading it backward or changing the tense of verbs. This can often help you access new meaning in old text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&#39;ve completed this final step, you have your final draft ready to submit.</p>', '2023-04-19 06:55:23', '2023-04-19 06:55:23'),

(142, 56, 'Steps to upskill to meet the copywriting demands', '1', 'steps-to-upskill-to-meet-the-copywriting-demands', '<h2>Steps to upskill to meet the copywriting demands</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. AI copywriting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>AI copywriting has been gathering pace in the last few years, and 2023 will be the year when it becomes mainstream. However, there is no need for concern. You&rsquo;re not about to be replaced by super-intelligent cyborgs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of artificial intelligence in copywriting is more for time and energy-saving. While the technology is impressive, it still lacks the &lsquo;human touch.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Savvy copywriters are using AI copywriting tools to assist them rather than seeing them as something that will replace them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, AI copywriting is fantastic for creating rough drafts, which a writer can polish and add personal touches and flair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI copywriting can also show writers where they can improve copy at a glance. AI copywriting tools to check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://copy.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Copy.ai</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jasper.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jasper.ai</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. From copywriter to copywriting consultant</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend is a follow-on from the AI copywriting trend. As artificial intelligence becomes smarter and creates a realistic copy, human copywriters will be seen in a more consultative role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; the copywriting, you will become someone who gives advice and creates frameworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use knowledge of this trend to your advantage by helping your customers. Ask them what difficulties they have and how copy can solve those problems. How can you help them with their overall content marketing strategy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start demonstrating that &lsquo;consultant&rsquo; side of you now to stay ahead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;doing&rsquo; copywriters will fall by the wayside as AI becomes even more intelligent, but you&rsquo;ll have nothing to worry about as a copywriting consultant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Interactive content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chatbots have become the norm as interactive content in the last few years, and in 2023, they&rsquo;re set to become even more popular with advancements such as natural language processing and machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&#39;s augmented reality which sounded so futuristic just two to three years ago but is already becoming normal for forward-thinking businesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you fit into this as a copywriter? It&rsquo;s simple. Interactive content still requires intelligent, well-thought-out content.&nbsp;In fact, tailoring content can require&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ve had a bad chatbot experience. Yes, some of that experience may be to do with software issues, but a lot of it has to do with bad or no copywriting. &lsquo;Canned&rsquo; responses that don&rsquo;t help a customer or lead them to a dead end are not only a lost opportunity but can also lead to complaints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you demonstrate the need for great copy, no matter how futuristic-sounding the technology is. Great content is great content and will always be necessary, no matter the form it comes in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Copywriting for video</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Video is the most consumed content online and has been for several years., It will be no different in 2023 as it continues to dominate copywriting trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Offer video copywriting in the form of scripts and video strategy will become a key tool in your arsenal to attract and keep customers going forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scriptwriting for videos will also change depending on the platform. For example, TikTok is known for short-form videos, while YouTube is the king of longer videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating your knowledge of best practices and what converts best on different platforms will earmark you as the copywriter to hire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already have skills in this department, let your current clients know by demonstrating your knowledge of whatever platform they use to generate leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have video copywriting skills, now is the time to upskill.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Consistent brand tone on all channels</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another trend gathering pace for a few years is the need for a brand to sound uniform across all channels and platforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is great news for you as you can use this knowledge to negotiate bigger projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Educate them on why having different writers for blog posts, LinkedIn, web copy, adverts, etc., hurts their conversions and sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes far more sense for one copywriter to handle all the content (or, if that&rsquo;s too much, be the copywriting consultant that manages and delegates to others) to ensure a consistent brand tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Webinars</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Webinars continue to be a key content marketing trend that shows no sign of stopping in 2023, and it&rsquo;s understandable why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webinars are a great place for businesses to showcase their products and allow their customer to engage with the brand fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many brands don&rsquo;t use webinars because of the time and effort spent on content creation, such as scripts, presentation slides, handouts, promo copy, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrate your knowledge in this area to current and prospective customers (and if you don&rsquo;t know, learn it!) They&rsquo;re likely leaving money on the table by not utilizing webinars in their content marketing, and your copywriting could be the key to unlocking these profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Using FAQs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that 14% of all searches on Google searches start with the word &lsquo;how?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means millions of people every day look for answers to their questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know that the aim of all content marketing is to answer those questions. But online attention spans continue to drop, so the average person makes snap judgments about whether your content will give them the answer they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what FAQs are one of the biggest copywriting trends. If someone spots a question that is identical (or almost identical) to the one they&rsquo;ve searched on Google, they&rsquo;re more likely to click on your content than a competitor&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, a lot of businesses either don&rsquo;t have an FAQ section or see it as somewhere to dump a few general questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intelligent business owners keep tabs on what their ideal customers are typing into Google and other search engines and use this to create FAQs that customers actually ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now that you have this vital information, you can also wow your customers by creating FAQs that get them noticed by their potential customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Case study-based storytelling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t need to tell you that storytelling is one of the most important things you&rsquo;ll learn to create high-quality content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend is all about marrying storytelling with data. Stories are the key to grabbing and keeping the attention from a target audience. However, it&rsquo;s hard facts we want to see when making a buying decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using both is the key to gaining attention that converts into sales.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create stories based on case studies. Start with the problem a particular customer had and how they tried to find a solution without success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now enters the product or service in your story. Demonstrate with hard facts and figures how the problem was solved. How did the product or service save or make money, and how much? Or how much time did the product or service save, etc.?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your current clients are not using case study-based storytelling, now is the time to tell them they&rsquo;re missing out!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Repurposing as a content marketing strategy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Repurposing content is not new, but 2023 will be the year more businesses realize how much content they already have, and it&rsquo;s a more efficient content strategy to repurpose than keep generating new content all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem? Repurposing does not mean just taking content wholesale from one platform and dumping it into another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, you wouldn&rsquo;t take a 2,000-word article and send that as an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem for businesses is that repurposing takes time and effort. That&rsquo;s where you come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrate your understanding of different platforms and best practices for repurposing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, you could tell a client that a 2,000-word article is best summarized into two to three &lsquo;teaser&rsquo; paragraphs for an email and then a link to the original article.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or you can rewrite the article into &lsquo;episodes&rsquo; to go out via email sequentially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefit for you is that you are creating work for yourself, and the work is relatively easy as there&rsquo;s no research or content creation from scratch involved - just rewriting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Voice search</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more people have smart speakers, which will change the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we go into 2023, how your copy looks will be less important. Instead, how you use words and how they&nbsp;<em>sound&nbsp;</em>in voice search will become more important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will likely be a move away from keyword-focused titles and headings. Instead, it would make sense for titles and headings to be framed as sentences that a user would use to ask for something in voice searches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11. Copy that works when English is a foreign language</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we become a global neighborhood, the need for copy that is understood and resonates has become a key content marketing trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even within English-speaking countries, there can be huge differences in the context of certain words and phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more and more companies cater to global audiences, as a copywriter, you need to ensure you write copy that works whether someone speaks British English, US English, or even English as a foreign language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>12. Long-form copy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be surprising, given the trend for video content. But there appears to be an opposite reaction happening here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As people prefer watching videos, when they do want to read, they prefer well-researched, intelligently-written long-form content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, for social media marketing, the content is getting shorter, but outside of the social media world, it&#39;s getting longer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>13. Podcasts will become even more popular</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more businesses realize how podcasts can generate highly qualified leads from their target audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When people listen to podcasts, they usually give them their undivided attention. Compare that to social media platforms, where we&rsquo;re constantly distracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s why leads that come from podcasts are of a higher quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does this affect you as a copywriter?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many brands and businesses would love to start a podcast but are scared of the time and effort it will take to create content ideas and scripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where you come in! You can help write scripts and episode plans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not many copywriters have these skills, so make sure you learn to stay ahead of the game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>14. Email marketing remains king of the digital marketing trends</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, someone will herald the death of emails. And each year, the evidence points to email marketing as the digital marketing trend that generates the highest ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend will continue in 2023. If you&rsquo;re a skilled email copywriter, push those skills to the forefront when speaking to potential customers and encourage them to increase their email marketing efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if email copywriting is something you&rsquo;ve never done before, consider upskilling yourself - it will be worth it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>15. Doubling up content as a content marketing strategy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many businesses miss opportunities to add other content formats to already existing content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous content could be made more attractive, understandable, and even more search-friendly by adding, for example, infographics, custom graphics, or videos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more content formats you use, the more chances you have to grab attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with content repurposing, this doubling-up content strategy is a great way to create new projects for your customers that are relatively easy to do as you&rsquo;re using existing content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>16. Updating old content as a content marketing strategy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like repurposing content and doubling up content, most business owners forget content they&#39;ve previously posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Google, the age of a website is very important. The older a website, the more credibility and authority it has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it also needs to see that the website is being updated regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most business owners assume this means pumping out new content regularly. While they need to do this, they&rsquo;re missing an easier content strategy option right under their noses - updating their old content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at expert content marketers such as Hubspot, for example. Many of their articles will have a note saying the original article is from several years ago, but it&rsquo;s been updated for this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They do this because they know Google and other search engines will notice the update and boost their articles to higher search results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use this knowledge when speaking to your customers. As them about previous blog posts, articles, and other content. Tell them you can easily update them with new, relevant information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could find you&rsquo;ve created a huge, lucrative project if they have an extensive library of previous content!</p>', '2023-04-19 07:02:57', '2023-04-19 07:02:57'),

However, you can use your posts to give a &#39;feel&#39; of who you are and what you do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, Instagram is a visual social media service. When someone arrives on your profile, they will see a grid of your most recent posts. This differs from the &#39;feed&#39; style of recent posts you see on Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional Instagram marketers use this to their advantage by setting a &#39;brand voice&#39; early on. This means all posts have the same colors, fonts, etc., so there is a harmonious and professional feel when someone lands on the Instagram profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start to see your Instagram profile page as the homepage of a website. Would you think it was professional if you stumbled across a website with no discernable branding and all kinds of colors and fonts?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Create Instagram content that meets your audience&#39;s needs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;d think this would be a given for copywriters, as we spend a lot of time determining audience needs when writing content for our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, we often miss this when it comes to our own marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your ideal client is a small business, creating content about copywriting tips or your copywriting services won&#39;t work. Most small business owners aren&#39;t aware of how a copywriter can solve their problems, such as low sales, stiff competition, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, focus your content on business growth. All business owners want to grow, no matter how big or small. Educate them on how good copywriting can grow their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Create regular content to find clients</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While each social networking service has differing algorithms, they all agree on one aspect. The more you post, the more the platform will show your posts to others. The Instagram algorithm is no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing a few posts for a week and then dropping off the radar is a waste of your time and effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to generate leads from Instagram, you need to dedicate some time to posting regularly, ideally once per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is as Instagram is a visual social media platform, you don&#39;t have to write much. It&#39;s all about creating eye-catching visuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have fun with content creation!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you love funny memes and jokes? Do you have some favorite motivating quotes? Your Instagram account is where you can share them as it shows off your personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, don&#39;t be afraid to &#39;re-use&#39; content elsewhere (make sure you attribute it, so you&#39;re not accused of repurposing other people&#39;s content as your own). This is called content curation, and it&#39;s a great way to save time on creating your own content while still showing off who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember to use your brand voice throughout all your posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use hashtags intelligently</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve written SEO content for clients as a copywriter, you&#39;ll know that trying to rank for the highest searched keywords on Google is not a great strategy. There&#39;s usually far too much competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more intelligent approach is to use high-intent longtail keywords with lower search volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, many writers forget about this when it comes to Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using ultra-popular hashtags with millions of mentions will mean your posts get lost in a sea of noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, focus on hashtags with a few thousand to under 400k mentions. They&#39;re still popular, but not so crazy popular that you get lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use hashtags that represent you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is similar to brand voice. There&#39;s more to you than &#39;just&#39; copywriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps you focus on clients who have sustainable or green goals? Maybe you&#39;re proud of owning a woman-owned business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find hashtags that represent these aspects of your business. Yes, you need to use hashtags focused on what you do, but it pays to add hashtags that go beyond this and show prospective clients who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to long term clients is people resonating with who you are and not just your great copywriting skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Social media marketing is a two-way street</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As copywriters, we&#39;re guilty of seeing social media marketing as a one-way avenue. We create content for our clients, who broadcast it to their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, social media marketing works in both directions. Savvy copywriters know this as well as savvy business owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spend time looking at other people&#39;s Instagram posts, particularly those who could be future copywriting clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like their posts and, even better, write meaningful comments. It&#39;s easy to hit the like button, but a comment takes time, and your prospective clients will notice the effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people&#39;s guards are down on social media, especially somewhere like Instagram.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas cold emailing or cold calling puts people in a defensive mode, a comment on an Instagram post by a stranger rarely causes negativity, especially if the comment is positive and meaningful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Think in terms of friends first and freelance clients second</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&#39;ve got a potential client&#39;s attention, sending them a direct message is acceptable. Remember, this is not like cold emails or cold calling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, don&#39;t abuse this. As their guard will be down, you don&#39;t want to go directly into &quot;sell, sell, sell!&quot; Doing this will be even worse than getting the brush off when cold calling - at least they were expecting the pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, think in terms of being a friend, not a salesperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get to know your prospective client. How are they doing? Who are they? What&#39;s important to them? Let your conversation flow naturally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust us. If they enjoy the conversion, you can bet they&#39;ve checked out your Instagram profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you follow the first and second steps in this Instagram social media marketing strategy, your brand voice and posts will tell them everything they need to know about what you do and how they can benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Show off your writing prowess</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, Instagram is a visual social media platform, so do not write long blog posts or huge press release-style posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you&#39;re a copywriter. You can bet your potential clients will judge your words on your Instagram posts. After all, if you knew someone was a photographer, you&#39;d check out the quality of their photos, correct?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of your Instagram posts as a mini portfolio of your work. Yes, you can&rsquo;t show off long-form writing style, but you can certainly show off short-form and medium-form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use your posts to show how intelligently you can write captions and how engaging you can make your posts. Your potential clients will notice and want the same for their marketing.</p>', '2023-04-19 07:14:52', '2023-04-19 07:14:52'),

AIDA is a well-known formula that has been used repeatedly with proven success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is AIDA?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AIDA is a century-old copywriting formula widely used by writers to convert visitors into paying customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action, the four stages of the customer purchase process.

The headline, of course! Creating a great headline hooks your reader into reading through your blog post (the attention stage of AIDA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If nobody reads your copy, nobody buys your product. It&#39;s as simple as that. 80% of readers don&#39;t move past the headline, so you can&#39;t get to generate their interest, create desire and then compel them to take action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some strategies to craft a great headline are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Make it urgent</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When your headline conveys a sense of urgency, it implies that if the reader does not take action immediately, they will lose out on something special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can improve the click-through rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: 5 amazing makeup trends you are not aware of!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Quote specific numbers</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A specific headline grabs more attention. Imagine a headline that is &#39;How to lose weight!&#39; Now, compare that to How to lose 8kg in 30 days!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding &#39;8kg&#39; and &#39;30 days&#39; is more attention-grabbing as it arouses curiosity. A reader will think, &quot;Is it possible to lose that weight in just 30 days? How?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also adds credibility. Facts are specific. Lies are vague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: How I made $10,000 per month from writing sales copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Speak directly to your audience</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Know who your audience is and target it precisely. Mention the people you are writing for directly in the headline. Make them think, &quot;This is for me!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: Become a content marketing manager in just 6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Bring on the emotion</strong></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Supercharge your copy with emotion. Remember, the buying process is an emotional one. Get people&rsquo;s attention by using emotion-filled words and phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: Powerful stress-busting tips you need to know</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2) Speak directly to your buyer persona</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your target audience should feel that you are speaking directly to them throughout the copy, especially in the opening paragraph. You should use &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;your&rsquo; in your marketing language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes your prospects feel that you are paying special attention to them. For example, if your target buyer persona is a marketing manager, address your title to them personally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3) Use style elements</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Style elements like underlining, italics, and bold help certain ideas in your marketing copy to stand out. It&#39;s important to remember that prospects are not just attracted by how a copy reads but also how it looks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Styling it with different style elements helps it to stand out and drive the message home. But at the same time, don&#39;t overwhelm your viewer with over-styling. Use style elements only when it is appropriate. Ideally, you want to use them when mentioning anything that makes a reader think, &quot;That&#39;s me!&quot; (the interest stage of AIDA) or how the product or service will benefit them (the desire stage of AIDA).</p>', '2023-04-19 07:21:40', '2023-04-19 07:21:40'),

Because these writers need to write in bulk to make money, there is less focus on quality control, and many will publish badly written copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most writers of this type of content don&#39;t do any research and don&#39;t add their original viewpoint. They just change the order of words or phrases around as they don&#39;t have time to do a good job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can also lead to plagiarism, which is taking someone else&#39;s ideas and passing them off as one&#39;s own.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plagiarism is a serious offense. College students can get kicked out of college and many writers out of their job. If you publish plagiarized content on your own website, Google can penalize your ranking. The original content publisher may even sue you as you copied their content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3>Poorly paid freelance writers who become &#39;stuck&#39;</h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the volume of writing required to make money, writers working for content mills are caught in a vicious cycle. They are barely paid a living wage, so they churn out low-quality content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, in turn, results in a sorry-looking portfolio. High-end clients on the lookout for quality content won&#39;t bother with hiring these writers. So they&#39;re stuck working for these content mills as they can&#39;t find clients independently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many writers are then frustrated, give up on writing and look at other income streams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a decent income goal of earning $4,000/month, and you are being paid only 2 cents per word by a content mill, you&#39;ll have to write 200,000 words per month (or 200 blog posts of 1,000 words each).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can you write that much?

Even if you are an experienced writer of 200 articles, you don&rsquo;t have ownership of those articles. And when you sit down to write an author bio, you&#39;ll have nothing to show.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to earn good bucks as a legitimate freelance writer, you have to build authority and show evidence of your expertise as a professional writer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you write for a content mill, you&#39;re writing purely for SEO, which means you are basically writing for an algorithm. You&#39;re not writing to inspire people or to showcase your creative skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on, when you make your career as an independent freelance writer, you will have difficulty finding connections who recognize you for your writing skills.

(171, 45, 'What are some great SEO copywriting tips?', '1', 'what-are-some-great-seo-copywriting-tips', '<h2><strong>What are some great SEO copywriting tips?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of SEO copywriting tools and SEO copywriting tips employed by SEO copywriters to improve the authority and relevance of their content and get their web page easily found by a search engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They do this by using specific target keywords so that search engine users will readily find the content. When Google sees its relevancy, it ranks that site higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s some SEO best practices to rank content in the top 10 of Google and increase traffic to a site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1.&nbsp; Site speed for web pages, landing pages, and category pages</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies have revealed that nearly half the people who click on a page in their Google search will abandon it if it takes more than 3 seconds to load.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last decade, website loading times have made a huge impact on site ranking. Even if you have labored for hours to produce useful, interesting content, if the site loading time is more than 3 seconds, you&#39;ll find people will quickly leave. These days, the attention span of users is very short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, analyze the site&rsquo;s speed by utilizing standard speed tests and Google Analytics tools. Then take action to decrease loading time below 3 seconds. Next, check the speed history again to see if the loading time of the web page has improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2.&nbsp; Attention-grabbing headline or title tag</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Only one in five people will read past the headline of a piece of content. The rest will coast away if they find a headline boring. Around 80% of a blog post&rsquo;s success depends on an attention-grabbing headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key element of SEO copywriting is, therefore, its headline. Keep these factors in mind while crafting one:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In today&rsquo;s marketing world, the headline should prompt the viewers to click and read further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>It should be clickable and attractive. The headline should have the relevant keywords that people search for.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>If you want to be a successful SEO copywriter, create the headline first and then move on to the body of the blog post. This will help the content to be found by search engines faster.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Convey a specific message to the target audience in the headline.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Include a number or figure if possible</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Keep your title under 72 characters to increase click-through rates.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the above tips will attract organic visitors to your client&#39;s site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Quality Content&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Content is an essential element of SEO copywriting success. Instead of focusing just on keyword stuffing, a copywriter should focus on the quality of the content of their SEO writing. You can improve the content for content marketing by paying attention to the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Content should be fresh and useful for humans (and not just geared towards search engines).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Use competitive keywords and keyword phrases (and don&rsquo;t stuff keywords).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Put the relevant keywords in your headline.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Make your headline readable from an SEO perspective.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Understand the user intent of your readers and target them.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Blog posts should be longer than 1000 words.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Write content that understands and solves the problem of your readers.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Write a compelling introduction that draws the reader in and makes them want to stay on the page.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Optimize your SEO copy by downloading a WordPress plugin called Yoast SEO. It will help you to get a site ranked higher on Google if you follow its prompts.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Meta Title and Meta Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of meta description is to help search engines understand the content. A meta description is used by Google as a snippet. The snippet copy will help search engine users to see if the page is relevant to their search query.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of meta description is to help search engines understand the content. A meta description is used by Google as a snippet. The snippet copy will help search engine users to see if the page is relevant to their search query.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to rank high on Google and catch people&rsquo;s attention, follow this checklist for writing a meta description:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Make sure the keyword intent behind your keywords is correct. The intent of your client&#39;s business should be clear in the keywords.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Keep your meta description under 150 characters (including spaces).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>For mobiles, keep it under 113 characters (remember, more searches are done on mobile than any other device, so it&#39;s best to optimize for mobile over anything else).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Along with a short description, include a call to action.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Target keywords should be included (they will be bolded in a query and help the page rank).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Your meta description should be unique to the page.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Frequency of targeted keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of times specific keywords appear on the page determines the keyword frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent times keyword frequency has lost a lot of its importance due to changes in the Google algorithm, but it still stands in the top 200 ranking factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s best to avoid having a keyword density of more than 5.5%. Doing so will flag your blog posts as &#39;spammy&#39; to Google and other search engines, which means they could penalise it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Links</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The building blocks of a web page are links. Link building will help a website rank higher in Google searches and increase search volume. Here are the types of links useful for SEO copy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Internal page links that link to more useful, relevant content.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Links to social media platforms to give Google relevancy and social clues (google pays attention to social media marketing)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>External page links show you value other people&rsquo;s content.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary mission of search engines like Google is to organize all the online information in the world. Links help search engines understand the content marketing strategy so they can send the best visitors to your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, to be successful in link building, you need to make sure your content creation is focused on human users first and search engines second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, internal links to other existing content on the site are a great idea, but only if they&#39;re relevant. Don&#39;t just link to any page for the sake of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linking to external sites is a great way to show Google the intent of your content. However, you should not link to any site you find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some sites are &#39;low value&#39; in Google&#39;s eyes as they&#39;re spammy or &#39;thin&#39; on content that humans want to read. Linking to sites like these will not help you&#39;re standing with Google. In fact, it could even harm your Google ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stick to well-established, authority sites. Ideal sites to link to are those that end with .gov, .edu, or .edu.</p>', '2023-04-19 08:07:51', '2023-04-19 08:07:51'),
(172, 45, 'What are the different approaches to SEO copywriting?', '1', 'what-are-the-different-approaches-to-seo-copywriting', '<h2><strong>What are the different approaches to SEO copywriting?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Write useful content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best SEO copywriting tips is to write useful content for human that is also great SEO content. There is no other way around it. People love good and useful content that flows naturally and are likelier to stick to your blog post if they find it interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than mere keyword stuffing, this is the best way to generate leads for your brand. Studies have proven that along with being useful, content should have these four features:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Write high-quality content that is fresh (don&#39;t regurgitate information that&#39;s already out there, give it a fresh spin).</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Optimize your content with well-researched keywords where you&#39;ve studied keyword intent.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Gain sufficient, relevant backlinks (this is where other sites link to your site).&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use keyword research and search intent.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keyword research is an important aspect of the approach to SEO copywriting. Along with keyword research, you should also be aware of its intent. Before you solve your target audience&#39;s problems, you should know what the keyword used stands for and whether it fulfils the search intent of viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to the classification of keywords also. There are generally two types of keywords:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Informational keywords are used by people who want to search for useful information for free without paying for it. They are generally how-to words. People using these keywords are generally not buyers. It&#39;s best to use these keywords in your title tags to cultivate an audience, guide them to your brand, and encourage them to buy a product or service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Commercial keywords are used by people when they intend to buy something. They are used by the searcher when they are desperate to take action to buy a product. Some examples of commercial intent keywords are review, buy, order, free, comparison, best, fast, etc. The person who is searching with a commercial keyword usually wants to buy a product, or they may sign up for an email that will lead them to convert as buyers.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here are the three steps to using a target keyword in your copy:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Use the target keyword in the title.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Use alternative keywords in the meta description as well as in your introduction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Write the content naturally for human readers and keep an eye on keyword density (don&#39;t stuff keywords)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Write the conclusion with the primary keyword inside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use long-tail keywords and short-tail keywords</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Short-tail keywords are three words or less, while long-tail keywords are more than three words. SEO firms use long-tail keywords to get your page to the top of search engine results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantage of using long-tail keywords is that as they grow longer, the search volume gets lower but more specific or relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if someone searches for &#39;Ford Ka,&#39; they could be looking to buy a car, or they are just looking for information. If you&#39;re writing for a car dealership, someone just searching for &#39;Ford Ka&#39; does not mean they want to buy a car. Even if they do, they could be hundreds of miles away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if someone searches for &#39;Ford Ka in Birmingham, UK,&#39; that&#39;s far more relevant. Yes, there will be far fewer searches than &#39;Ford Ka,&#39; but those searchers will be far more relevant to your car dealership client. Quality of searches trump quantity from a commercial point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, long-tail keywords have higher conversion rates than short-tail keywords.

When people discover their products/services, they&rsquo;re &lsquo;sold.&rsquo; They resonate with the message and take positive action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if your client says they need more leads but have a low conversion rate, it means something is off. They don&rsquo;t need more leads. They need to convert more of their existing leads. One reason could be an issue with the brand tone of voice with the existing content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Which businesses do you consider your competitors?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This question allows you to see what others are doing and the tone of voice they are using that could be working for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct competitors are businesses that have the same target audience as your client. If you discover that a competitor has a lion&rsquo;s share of the market, it&rsquo;s common sense to analyze the tone of voice their content is taking.

For example, passionate, dry, bold, down-to-earth, informative, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ultimately, all business content falls into five tones of voice types:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Energetic</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Dependable</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Elegant/Expensive</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Irreverent</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Innovative</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding which of the five your client&rsquo;s audience falls into will make or break your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples using the five tone of voice types.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Energetic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a good tone of voice to hit if your client&rsquo;s ideal customers/clients are in the youth market (e.g. teen clothes, &lsquo;young&rsquo; social media networks and apps, etc.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also works well in markets designed to utilize energy, such as gyms, sports clothing, exercise programs, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to hit an energetic brand tone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An energetic style guide uses lots of bullet-pointed or numbered lists. Don&rsquo;t use long sentences with a ton of conjunctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fragmented sentence structure with a motivating tone works well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, use short words for a brand voice that packs a punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a great energetic tone of voice example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the entire content piece at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/womens-3-day-glute-workout</u></a><u>.&nbsp;</u>Can you see how the brand&#39;s voice has a &#39;go-getter&#39; personality with a motivating tone throughout?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dependable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the perfect tone of voice when your client&rsquo;s products/services are something that their clients/customers rely on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product or service may not be the most exciting, but people value these products or services for their dependability over excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great examples are insurance companies, payment/merchant service providers, hosting companies, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean your words can&rsquo;t inject a little energy or humor. But keep in mind that the audience is ultimately looking for safety. &nbsp;Use a more formal tone of voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to hit a dependable brand tone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dependable style guide uses words that are wholesome and feel comfortable and warm.&nbsp;At the same time, you want a slightly authoritative tone of voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so than any other tone type, avoid using any words that can offend, such as curse words. This will likely go against brand values. This is not the audience to be &lsquo;edgy&rsquo; with. Avoid using slang or colloquialisms for the same reason.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a good dependable tone of voice example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the entire content piece at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/life-insurance/</u></a>. Check out the respectful tone and writing style throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Elegant/Expensive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the must-use tone of voice for high-end items, boutiques, or any product or service that&rsquo;s targeted at the affluent. It&rsquo;s also an ideal tone of voice for salons, spas, and resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to hit an elegant and expensive brand tone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An elegant and expensive style guide uses a longer sentence structure that flows well with conjunctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use adjectives to create a world inside the reader&rsquo;s mind so they can imagine the pleasure. Keep content about the functional aspect of a product or service to a minimum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid using action-oriented words and short, punchy sentences. Nothing in your content should convey that there is a rush.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at this example of an elegant/expensive brand tone of voice:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the entire content piece at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joali.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://www.joali.com/</u></a>&nbsp;to see the brand&#39;s tone and brand personality that oozes luxury and elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Irreverent</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a humorous tone of voice for businesses and brands who want to be seen as &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; thinkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it lends itself to apps and games targeted at the youth (especially males) as well as street brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, irreverent, offbeat humor can be used for all kinds of products and services - it&rsquo;s all about knowing your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to hit an irreverent brand tone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Merriam-Webster, irreverent means &ldquo;lacking proper respect or seriousness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, you need to understand the audience to know what they like to disrespect - it&rsquo;s not a case of just disrespecting anything and everything! Therefore, hitting the right irreverent tone of voice is a bit harder than other tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your client needs to give you lots of tone of voice guidelines regarding their perfect customers/clients. so you can assess personality traits, word choice, and communication style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the best irreverent tone of voice examples for a &hellip; wait for it&hellip; life insurance company called Dead Happy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the unique tone of the entire content piece at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deadhappy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://deadhappy.com/</u></a>. We&#39;re sure you&#39;ll agree. It&#39;s a very unique brand voice with a clear tone and very distinct personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see with this example, this flies against the earlier advice that insurance companies should go for a more dependable tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the reason why this content works so well is that the business knows its audience (young, upwardly mobile, and savvy, who love dark humor). They are able to show off the brand&#39;s personality with offbeat humor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Innovative</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It will come as no surprise that this tone of voice is perfect for software companies, app firms, and any product/service which is cutting edge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your client can succinctly tell you that &ldquo;no one is doing exactly what we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo; when you ask about their competitors, you know you have an innovative brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have competitors at all. But they will have major differentiation points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to hit an innovative brand tone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovative people tend to use fewer words. So keep your content succinct.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, don&rsquo;t be overly formal. Think of how we became accustomed to seeing Steve Jobs in jeans. Innovative brands prefer conversational language with an informative tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, don&rsquo;t go overboard and start using colloquial language that starts hitting an irreverent tone. Word choice is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, testimonials that &lsquo;prove&rsquo; how great a product/service is will work better than marketing messages. That&rsquo;s true for all brands, but more so for innovative brands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a good innovative tone of voice example:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the entire content piece at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://streamyard.com/%EF%BF%BC\" target=\"_blank\">https://streamyard.com/</a>&nbsp;where you can see the innovative brand personality and tone of voice, together with a powerful testimonial.</p>', '2023-04-19 08:31:38', '2023-04-19 08:31:38'),

Instead, we will hold back and summarise the most critical parts to get your brain cogs turning!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp; Conduct Market Research</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Market research is the foundation of any copywriting business, the copywriter&#39;s content and the inspiration for ideas and progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the broader landscape of copywriting marketing gives you insights into industry trends, modern customer preferences and any market shifts that will help you build an up-to-date and sustainable business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/convertkit\">CovertKit</a> is a great tool to help you grow and monetise your audience, and from only $9.00/month for a creator&rsquo;s account, it&rsquo;s a worthy investment in your future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Choosing your Niche and Copywriting Specialities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting a business from scratch is a challenging task. But gathering information on what you want your niche and specialities to be once you are up and running is a vital step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One option is to open a business as a generalist copywriting business. This is an excellent option for start-ups to gain clients, credibility, social proof and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your second option is to focus on subjects you are passionate about and knowledgeable about. For example, if you studied business and media, taking this approach with your services can be a great way to promise success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, you can base your niche on those with high demand in the industry. Tools like <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/feedly\">Feedly</a> will help inform you about current viral topics and news.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Writing a Business Plan to Succeed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you got a strategy in mind, goals you wish to achieve, and targets for the next three years? Get them all documented in a business plan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thoughts and ideas may have gotten you this far, but constructing a solid business plan will take control from now on. Believe us when we say it is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4.&nbsp; A Strong Portfolio</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the essential parts of starting a copywriting business with client value is advertising and showcasing your capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong portfolio that highlights your diversity and reliability will surely bring in clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will you reach a boarder audience through your online portfolio, but it is also an excellent way to show off those writing skills. Selling yourself to a potential client is a great way to show talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5.&nbsp; Discussing Your Rates</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your rates will change over time, and depending on how experienced you are when starting your business, rates can range over vast numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may choose to charge per hour, per word, or project. Either way, the most important thing to remember is that you charge for skill, value and quality of work. <em>Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6.&nbsp; Building Your Network</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Network building is one of the often forgotten or skipped steps in creating a sustainable business, but its power can result in rapid success in expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can easily begin networking online. For example, a LinkedIn account is a great way to find connections to benefit your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7.&nbsp; Accounting System</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Owning your own business will entail handling your own administrative work, so you&rsquo;re in luck if you have an accounting degree!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From spending to payments, your accounting system should be a top priority step on this list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise keeping a Google spreadsheet to track income and expenses. A visual aid will help you crunch those numbers!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8.&nbsp; Marketing and Social Presence</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to market yourself for the business to pick up. Let the world know you&rsquo;re ready to create awesome content!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is a great way to do this. Creating a social presence on platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter is a great way to advertise your service in today&rsquo;s technology-driven society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look out for business start-up events, print creative and witty calling cards with your details and <em>sell</em>, <em>sell</em>, <em>sell</em>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>9.&nbsp; Self-Development and Consistency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/\"><u>The Author&rsquo;s Pad</u></a>, we believe that self-development is a process that never ends once on the career path of a copywriter.

To help you perfect your skills, here are some tips and tricks for mastering proofreading.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take Your Time and Read Carefully</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important part of proofreading is to read your work slowly and carefully. This helps you pay attention to details that you may have missed or overlooked before. Reading out loud can also be helpful, as it forces you to take your time and focus on errors that may have been overlooked when reading silently.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check Your Spelling and Grammar</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When proofreading your work, always check for spelling and grammar mistakes. This can be done manually or with the help of a computer program such as Microsoft Word or a web-based grammar checker such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/grammarly\">Grammarly</a>. As mentioned, make sure to read your work out loud when checking for errors, as this helps you identify mistakes that may have been missed when reading silently.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check for Consistency</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining a consistent style and tone is essential when writing and good proofreading can help ensure that you have achieved this. You should also check that you have spelled names and titles correctly and consistently and that any abbreviations or acronyms are used correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check for Accuracy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to catching typos and other grammar and spelling mistakes, it is also important to check for factual accuracy. Make sure that all information is correct and up-to-date, as providing incorrect information can negatively affect the credibility of your work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check for Clarity and Flow</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before submitting your work, make sure to check for clarity and flow. This can be done by reading your work out loud and making sure that everything is clear and logically structured. If something doesn&rsquo;t make sense or seems unclear, take the time to rewrite it until it is perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also check that your work is easy to understand by using tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/hemingway-editor\">Hemingway Editor</a> to ensure that your content is readable and easy to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use a Fresh Set of Eyes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are having trouble finding errors, try asking a friend or colleague to take a look at your work. This will give you a fresh set of eyes that can help you identify mistakes that you may have missed and can be a great final check/</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check Formatting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to checking your work for spelling and grammar mistakes, it is also important to check the formatting of your writing. Proper formatting includes elements such as font size, line spacing, margins, and page numbers. Attention to detail in these areas ensures a professional and polished appearance for your copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Make Sure You Know The Language</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>English has subtle differences in usage across various countries, which can make proofreading challenging. It is important to have a strong understanding of the language and utilise resources, such as dictionaries or online tools, to clarify unfamiliar words or phrases, such as slang or colloquialisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proofreading tools like Grammarly and UK vs US Spelling can be useful for identifying and correcting errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and syntax, which can result in a more polished and error-free final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take Breaks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Proofreading can be tedious work, so it is important to take breaks when needed.

Here are some tips and techniques to help you edit your copywriting for success:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp; Read Through Your Work Carefully</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the time to read through your writing carefully before you start making changes or edits. This allows you to get a sense of how the piece flows and identify any areas where it might need additional work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; Eliminate Any Unnecessary Words or Fluff</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Remove any words or phrases that don&rsquo;t add to the overall message of the piece - but remember to maintain clarity. While it&#39;s important to be concise, you also want to make sure that your copy is clear and easy to understand - excessive use of big words or overly long sentences can detract from the message.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Check For Spelling And Grammar Mistakes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mistakes in spelling and grammar can distract from your message, and they can also make you come across as unprofessional. Be sure to double-check for any errors before submitting your copy, and run your text through a checker such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/grammarly\">Grammarly </a>to ensure that you catch any errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.&nbsp; Check for Clarity and Flow</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Read through your writing to make sure that it&#39;s clear and easy to follow.; make sure that any transitions between topics are smooth and that each paragraph ties back to the message of the piece. You can also check that sentences make good sense and that the piece flows well and is pleasant and clear to read - tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/readable\">Readable </a>and <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/hemingway-editor\">Hemingway Editor</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Use Active Voice Whenever Possible</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Active voice helps to make your writing more engaging and direct, so use it whenever possible. Avoid passive voice as much as you can, as it can make your writing sound dull and disconnected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.&nbsp; Give Your Writing A Purpose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure that your writing has a purpose, and that this purpose is clear throughout the piece. Every sentence should contribute to the overall message of the copy, so if something doesn&#39;t fit, it&#39;s best to delete it or rewrite it. When proofreading, ensure that each sentence has a clear purpose in the context of the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every sentence should have a purpose, and each one should lead logically to the next. Make sure your writing is focused and that you&rsquo;re not straying from your main topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.&nbsp; Know Your Target Audience</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Always remember to keep your target audience in mind when editing. When you understand who you&#39;re writing for and what they are looking for, it&#39;s easier to ensure that your copy is clear and engaging and to tailor your message accordingly to ensure maximum impact and effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.&nbsp; Read Your Work Aloud</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Reading aloud is one of the best ways to catch any mistakes or awkward phrasing that may have slipped through the cracks when editing on paper. This helps ensure that your copy sounds natural and conversational, making it more engaging for the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9.&nbsp; Get Input from Others</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting feedback from other people is an important part of the editing process. Ask them to read through your copy and provide constructive criticism; this can help you identify any areas that need improvement, as well as any areas where you may have been unintentionally unclear or repetitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10.&nbsp; Use Editing Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Editing tools such as grammar checkers and spell checkers can be a great help when it comes to polishing your copy. While they won&#39;t necessarily identify any conceptual or structural issues, they can help you catch any typos or small mistakes that may have slipped through the cracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11.&nbsp; Take a Break and Come Back to It Later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be difficult to edit your own work, so don&#39;t be afraid to step away for a bit and come back to it with a fresh set of eyes. Taking some time away from the piece allows you to look at it with a more objective perspective, which can help you identify any areas where the copy may need additional work.</p>', '2023-04-25 07:25:35', '2023-04-25 07:25:35'),

There are a few top tips to keep in mind, and these include:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choose Your Language Wisely</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The language you use in your resume should be clear and concise; try and avoid using overly flowery language or jargon, as this can detract from the overall message you are trying to convey, and may put off potential employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, focus on strong action verbs that demonstrate your skills and capabilities - this will help to make your resume stand out and make a lasting impression. It also shows potential employers that you are efficient, and can focus on getting the job done properly. To help, consider <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/\">tools</a> such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/readable\">Readable </a>and <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/hemingway-editor\">Hemingway Editor</a> to check that your work is clear and easy to follow.</p>', '2023-05-08 02:23:44', '2023-05-08 02:23:44'),
(278, 79, 'Focus On Your Achievements', '1', 'focus-on-your-achievements', '<h3>Focus On Your Achievements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A resume should focus on what you have accomplished in your career, not just the tasks that you have performed. Make sure to highlight any awards, achievements, and successes that you have had in order to show potential employers your value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When writing about your experiences, instead of simply listing tasks, you should focus on the achievements or successes that you had in each role. This will help to demonstrate your value as an employee and provide potential employers with a more detailed picture of what you can bring to the role. For example, if you increase the customer satisfaction ratings at your previous job, make sure to include the figures and how you achieved them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Formatting Matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have written your resume, it is important to make sure that it is easy to read and digest. Choose a font that is clear and legible, and keep the formatting consistent throughout. Use bullet points whenever possible, as this makes it easier for employers to skim-read and find the key information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Showcase Your Skill Set</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers are looking for job candidates with specific skill sets, so make sure to showcase these in your resume. Describe the skills you possess, and provide examples of how you have used them in previous roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Storytelling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A great way to make your resume stand out is to use storytelling techniques. Tell a story about how you had an impact on your previous employer or organisation. This will help employers remember you and demonstrate the value that you can bring to their organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tailor Your Resume to the Job</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When writing your resume, make sure to customise the content for each job you apply for. This means focusing on the skills and experience that are most relevant to the particular role you are applying for, and which demonstrate your suitability clearly and obviously - doing this shows potential employers that you have taken the time to tailor your resume specifically for them, and helps you come across as a candidate dedicated to taking their role seriously, which can really help you stand out against other candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Industry-Specific Keywords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Including industry-specific keywords in your resume can be a great way to stand out from other applicants. Employers may use these keywords when searching for job candidates, so make sure to include them in your resume where appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Create a Compelling Summary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The summary section of your resume is an opportunity to showcase your achievements and make a good first impression on potential employers. Keep it succinct and avoid clich&eacute;d phrases such as &ldquo;hard-working&rdquo; or &ldquo;team player. Instead, focus on quantifying your accomplishments with concrete examples, such as how you saved money or increased productivity in a previous role.</p>', '2023-05-08 02:32:51', '2023-05-08 02:32:51'),

Create folders for each type of project that you do, such as website copywriting, newsletter writing, press releases, etc., and place all relevant samples in those folders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that if a client approaches for a specific type of work, you will have your samples ready to present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Organise by Platform</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you write for different types of platforms, such as print media or online media, create folders for each platform to keep all of your work organised. You can then create sub-folders for each type of project, such as print ads, website content, etc, and this will help you locate projects and pieces of work whenever required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Organise by Genre</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Categorising your portfolio based on the genre can be useful in showcasing your expertise in specific writing styles, like technical or creative writing, allowing potential clients to easily locate relevant writing samples and quickly determine whether you are a match for their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Organise by Date</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Organising a portfolio by date can provide practical benefits for those who update it frequently and wish to keep a record of their work over time. Additionally, it may simplify the process of locating samples from a specific time frame - you can simply head to the relevant file, and locate the piece as needed with minimal fuss or stress.</p>', '2023-05-10 13:51:24', '2023-05-10 13:51:24'),

In order to better understand its customer&rsquo;s needs and interests, Adobe conducted an in-depth survey of its customers in 2018 that asked them what kind of content they were looking for. The results showed that customers wanted more video tutorials, how-to guides, product reviews and interviews with experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to this feedback, Adobe created a content strategy that focused on creating high-quality video tutorials and how-to guides, as well as engaging interviews with industry experts. They also re-purposed some of their existing content such as blog posts and webinars in order to make sure they were getting the most out of their material. Finally, they used analytics tools such as Adobe Analytics to track the performance of their content and make sure it was resonating with their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through this comprehensive strategy, Adobe was able to come up with content ideas that were engaging and relevant to their customer&rsquo;s needs, helping them to build trust and connection with their audience. This, in turn, helped them to increase their sales, grow their customer base and become one of the leading brands in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2023-05-22 11:10:50', '2023-05-22 11:10:50');

We have a few suggestions:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Do Your Research</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to understand what topics and types of content resonate with your readers. Spend some time researching your audience by looking at competitors&#39; content, reading industry blogs, and paying attention to conversations on social media. This will give you an idea of what topics your target audience is interested in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/answer-the-public\">Answer the Public</a>, <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/ubersuggest\">Ubersuggest </a>and <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/also-asked\">Also Asked</a> can be very useful here - each of these gives you an insight into the mindset of the customers you are seeking and lets you know what they are looking for, how they are thinking, and where their priorities are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This information then allows you to create content that is tailored to the needs of your readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n2. Look For Trends</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep up with the latest trends in your industry and related industries. What topics are people talking about? What content is getting lots of likes and shares? Use this information to come up with content ideas that are relevant to your audience and will keep them engaged. Tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/google-trends\">Google Trends</a> can be very useful here, as you will be able to obtain a clear overview of the key trending topics in your industry and give you a chance to get ahead of the curve and meet your audience&#39;s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Take Advantage of Social Media</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is a great way to get feedback from your readers, which can help you come up with content ideas that will resonate with them. Look for conversations in which you can join, or start one yourself by asking your followers questions about topics related to your industry or products. See what kinds of answers you get, and use this information to generate content ideas that are relevant to your audience&rsquo;s interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Ask Your Audience What They Want</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also use surveys or polls to ask your readers what kind of content they want to see from you. Make sure the questions are clear and easy to understand, and keep it short and sweet - no one wants to spend hours filling out a survey! Once you have the results, use them to create content that your readers will love.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Use Content Generating Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are truly stuck for ideas, there are a number of tools that can help you to come up with ideas for your content. <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/hubspots-blog-topic-generator\">HubSpot&#39;s Blog Topic Generator </a>and <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/portents-content-idea-generator\">Portent&rsquo;s Content Idea Generator</a> are two great examples that you can use to generate fresh, creative ideas in just a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n6. Be Creative With Your Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to generating content ideas, don&#39;t be afraid to get creative and think outside the box. Try mixing different types of content such as videos, infographics, audio clips and long-form articles to keep your audience engaged. Experiment with interactive elements such as polls, quizzes and surveys to make your content more engaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n7. Repurpose Your Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Repurposing content is a great way to get the most out of your existing material and add new life to it. Take an old blog post or video and re-work it into something fresh and new, like an infographic or podcast. Not only does this save you time, but it also helps to keep your readers engaged as they are seeing something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n8. Analyse And Use Your Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important parts of generating content ideas is to track the performance of your content and learn from it. Use analytics tools such as Google Analytics or HubSpot to monitor which posts are performing best, and use this information to inform future content that you create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that when it comes to business and marketing, knowledge really is power - you need to ensure that you are always in the know when it comes to your audience&rsquo;s trends, interests and preferences, and having the analytics and data there in front of you is the key to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n9. Make Sure Your Content Is Original</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As technology and AI tools continue to grow and evolve, it is more important than ever to ensure that your content is original and not copied from elsewhere. Not only does this show that you have taken the time to create something unique, but it also helps to build trust with your readers. Use tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/copyscape\">Copyscape </a>to ensure that your content is not plagiarised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n10. Create High-Quality Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to ensuring that your content is original, you also want to make sure that it is of high quality. No matter how great your idea is, if the execution isn&rsquo;t up to scratch, then no one will want to read it. Take the time to proofread and edit your work before you post it, and consider using an online editor such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/grammarly\">Grammarly </a>to help you spot any typos or errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also ensure that content is divided into headings and subheadings to make it easy to read and that these include keywords that can help your piece rank - take advantage of tools such as <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/surfer-seo\">Surfer SEO </a>and <a href=\"https://theauthorspad.com/tool/semrush\">SEMRush </a>to generate relevant keywords and maximise your SEO.</p>', '2023-05-22 11:26:11', '2023-05-22 11:26:11'),

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
