Content Staging is an in-app separate content environment that allows you to update or create staged pages before publishing them to your production site. While HubSpot’s content staging tool allows you to redesign and relaunch your website in a sandbox development environment, it’s limited to website pages and landing pages.

The tags in HubSpot are universal, meaning they will apply to every blog. This is great if you have one blog in one language, but if you have two or three or even four blogs (all covering different topics), the tags won’t translate well into different languages (unless they are proper nouns).
